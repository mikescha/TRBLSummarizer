48490,2023 Merced NWR Deadman Wetland Ditch,,,Fumika,On-line recorder form,"There were some nesting red-winged blackbirds on the outskirts of the colony, some close to the recorder. My first visit to the colony on May 12 I saw lots of nest building activity and heard lots of calls, however when I set the recorder on May 23 the colony was very quiet. I still saw a few birds going in and out of the milkthistle but not nearly as many. I saw a few tricolors bringing insects into the milkthistle on June 1 and June 9, but less than 10 birds. On June 16 I entered the colony (appeared abandoned) and it looked like a lot of the nests were unused, lots of the milkthistle had fallen over in the wind or desiccated, with quite a few nests on the ground. A few nests had evidence of chicks (egg shells, feathers, poo). I didn't see any fledglings nearby or in the vicinity. "
48490,2023 Merced NWR Deadman Wetland Ditch,,,Fumika,On-line recorder form,There were about 200 birds nest building during the first visit. It dwindled to less than 10 birds by June 1. I counted ~150 nests after the colony abandoned. 
48464,2023 San Luis NWR - West Bank Creek,,,Fumika,On-line recorder form,The birds were nesting in a patch of milkthistle and mustard growing along the levee sides. An earthen canal near the levee had water May- June 22. The recorder was placed south of the colony near the canal. The colony was located near the edge of a dry seasonal wetland. 
48464,2023 San Luis NWR - West Bank Creek,,,Fumika,On-line recorder form,"During the nest building stage, I estimated around 500 birds. Most of the colony abandoned in June, I counted 40 tricolors on June 21. "
48464,2023 San Luis NWR - West Bank Creek,,,Fumika,On-line recorder form,"There were some red-winged blackbirds nesting near the recorder on the outskirts of the colony. On May 26 the colony was very active/noisy, I saw one tricolor bringing grass for nest building. June 9 the colony was very quiet, I saw a few males and 1 female present. June 14 I saw 40 tricolors, 1 seen bringing insects into the milkthistle. The milkthistle in June was very shriveled and breaking apart, by June 21 lots of the milkthistle had fallen over. June 29 I saw 5 tricolors, 2 carrying insects into the colony. I did not see any fledglings on any subsequent visits. "
48446,2023 Merced NWR - Cottonwood,,,Fumika,On-line recorder form,"I placed the recorder very close to the colony, alongside the milkthistle in some tall grass. The colony is in milkthistle patches alongside a canal ditch that had water. There was some mugwort along the canal as well.  "

48446,2023 Merced NWR - Cottonwood,,,Fumika,On-line recorder form,"colony may have fledged a few, but not many based on site visits. I saw that lots of the milkthistle had fallen over (7ft tall) when it started drying out. Some nests looked like they had evidence of chicks. "
48447,2023 San Luis Bear Creek,,,Fumika,On-line recorder form,"The birds nested in the willows and buttonbush in the river channel as well as the milkthistle along the levee. The birds in the milkthistle abandoned early (June 20) after the milkthistle dried up and fell over. I placed the recorder under some of the willow trees in mud near the water, I think the nests closest to the recorder abandoned. The colony successfully fledged chicks. "
48447,2023 San Luis Bear Creek,,,Fumika,On-line recorder form,during nestbuilding (June 15-21) there were 800-900 birds. Seemed to drop off to 200 birds during incubation. Saw around 60 fledglings. 
63114,2024 Merced NWR - Cottonwood Trail,,,Fumika,On-line recorder form,"Birds were nesting in a weedy field (mustard and milk thistle) next to an almond orchard. BIrds were travelling from the nearby dairies to the field. There were seasonal wetlands near the colony that the birds also used for foraging and sources of mud. Corn was planted near the colony, about 60 meters away during the beginning of the nesting attempts. The recorder was placed on the side of the colony, near the densest cluster. "

,2018 Red Wing Ranch,,,Deren Ross,e-mail,"Your google map is the ""Yankee Slough"" site where we banded in 2018. This site did fail in 2018. It started out around 3000 and eventually failed.  Very few fledglings observed. Less than 10.  Regarding your map for this site, the nest area stopped before the large loop on your map but extended about 200 feet north. So, it would be just the narrow section between the wide areas. See map below.  No tricolors here in 2019.
There were no tricolors at the ""Red Wing Ranch"" site this year (2019).  We did not monitor this site in 2018 but based on nests located in September (2018), after the breeding season, the nest area ran from the bridge (left marker) east to property line (right marker).  Of approximately 2300 feet, 1400 feet was used for nesting.  
I attached google maps showing the length of the nest area used at each site.
Hope this helps.

24231,2021 Rodeo Grounds 1,6/7/2021,,Chris Conard,,"No activity. Not sure what to say about this one. Had 160 birds in the area the first week, and then mostly 35 to 40, and two weeks ago, only 12 birds, but they were taking food to blackberries. They could have fledged or abandoned. Because feeding was observed, I think an estimate of 40 adults is reasonable."
24252,2021 Orchard Creek,5/29/2021,,Chris Conard,,"2500 birds. Continuing to feed young. About 20 fledglings visible. Some young still in nests as adults with food are going deep into berries. More evidence that the activity of this colony is stretched out, with some birds initiating nesting at least two weeks before others."
24231,2021 Rodeo Grounds 1,5/29/2021,,Chris Conard,,"No activity. There were only 12 birds seen last week, but they were taking food to blackberries. They could have fledged or abandoned."
24252,2021 Orchard Creek,5/21/2021,,Chris Conard,,"2500 birds. It was windy, so the conditions weren't ideal, but there was a lot of feeding and about a dozen fledglings were visible."
24231,2021 Rodeo Grounds 1,5/21/2021,,Chris Conard,,"12 birds. Distant, but even with a scope I couldn't see much. Saw a few females collecting food and delivering it to the colony site. Perhaps there are more birds incubating, but there is hardly any activity since the first week of 160 birds. Only two males seen."
24252,2021 Orchard Creek,5/18/2021,,Chris Conard,,2500 birds. A lot of feeding but still some nest building and courting. Definitely more than one stage going. Will see if there are any fledglings this coming Friday.
24231,2021 Rodeo Grounds 1,5/18/2021,,Chris Conard,,"9 birds. Distant, but even with a scope I couldn't see much. Maybe next week it will be clearer what's going on. Only two males and seven females seen, but females went into the blackberries that have been the focus of activity for the past four weeks. Possibly incubating. Will see."
24252,2021 Orchard Creek,5/9/2021,,Chris Conard,,"2500 birds. Back to full strength. Very actively nest-building, which is a surprise as there was some nest building two weeks ago and I figured they would be much farther along now. Either the first effort failed, was an early wave, or they're just getting revved up now. Will follow up next week."
24231,2021 Rodeo Grounds 1,5/9/2021,,Chris Conard,,"35 birds (a slight increase). Distant, but even with a scope I couldn't see many birds. Active, but barely apparent."
24252,2021 Orchard Creek,5/2/2021,,Chris Conard,,800 birds (down from 2500 birds last week). It was much more active last week and I suspect they are incubating right now.
24231,2021 Rodeo Grounds 1,5/2/2021,,Chris Conard,,"18 birds (down from 160 birds last week). A little distant, but even with a scope I couldn't see many birds. They may be incubating. Will see next week."
24252,2021 Orchard Creek,4/23/2021,,Chris Conard,,"2500 birds. It was much more active when I revisited it in the afternoon and my estimate went up from around 1200 to 2500. Just about to get started. Lots of singing, saw copulating, one female with nesting material (but only one). The rest of the time they foraged and then landed back on the Himalayan blackberry, with some females venturing inside."
24231,2021 Rodeo Grounds 1,4/23/2021,,Chris Conard,,"160 birds. A little distant, but with a scope could make out some nest building. Appeared to be a fairly small colony, but we'll see. New development going in pretty close to the colony site, but the birds seemed to have quite a bit of open space left to forage in."
63089,2024 SJWA Thistle NW of Bridge Street Pond,9/10/2024,,Dave Goodward,email,"The San Jacinto Wildlife Area continues to vex me and the birds.  As you will find in the recorder, the colony there was small and late, due directly to the  actions of Scott Sewell the manager.  Nobody in his CDFW hierarchy seems to have done anything to exert their influence to overrule his relegation of Tricolored Blackbirds to a species of little concern.  I know you avoid politics to maintain your scientific impartiality, so I tell you this simply as a matter of facts, to help explain the decline in tricolors this year.  The preferred nesting marsh was disked in the winter of 23-24, and did not have sufficient growth to support a colony this season. Last year's  colony site in the San Jacinto River channel was never irrigated, first due to a broken water line, but after it was fixed, no water was relegated to the site.  Lastly, the spring/summer wetland, which intermittently has supported tricolors and was established for their benefit, was never irrigated, despite no problems with the pumps or lines. "
66012,2024 Newberry Springs,9/10/2024,,Dave Goodward,email,"The Newberry Springs colony is still hanging on by a toenail, with two new colony sites that became suitable after the increased expense of water led to the owners dropping the water level and forgoing cattail maintenance. There was no alfalfa grown in Newberry Springs, only 3 Way hay in the spring plus bermudagrass. Last years pond was dry and abandoned. It’s a matter of a very few years until they are gone."
,2021 SJWA,6/18/2021,,Dave Goodward,eBird,"About 250 in a tight group in the marsh north of Bridge St. pond. No singing. Most were just hanging around, but a very small number of females were seen bringing insects in to squawking young in the center where the adults were perched. While these birds were in the marsh, there was a large flock of blackbirds foraging in the alfalfa to the west, but both TRBL and RWBL were present, and it was hard to get a count of the two species at distance. My best guess was 300 TRBL were in the alfalfa. Later there was movement between the two locations, but again, very little feeding of nestlings took place. As for the nestlings, I could hear individual birds rather than a loud chorus, and I suspect there were no more than 30 nests, maybe fewer."
63089,2024 SJWA Thistle NW of Bridge Street Pond,6/6/2024,,Dave Goodward,email,"Hello Scott et al., I placed the recording unit today near the shore of Mystic Lake near the thistle colony.  So far, production appears to be very low, with only about 20 juveniles fledged so far, but there appears to be newer activity at the other end of the thistle patch.  Food is coming from the dairy as it did in 2022.  The relatively cool weather will hopefully help this late nesting to be successful.  Dave"

Birds were seen leaving and returning, flying east to forage. Birds at the pond were largely fledglings. Later in the morning, approximately 10:30 there were only 75 birds at the pond.
