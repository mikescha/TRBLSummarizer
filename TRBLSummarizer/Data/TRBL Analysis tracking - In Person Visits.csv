At these earlier visits, several hundred birds were observed with a cacophony of noise. Still too early for fledglings to have left, so either the entire colony was away on an extended foraging trip or the colony has been largely abandoned.

Activity levels were extremely high and were accompanied by loud vocalizations. A handful of females were seen perched atop the patch with food in their beaks. A flock of nearly 100 birds (primarily males) were observed flying across the water and returning to the bush- 4 males were spotted carrying food and 4 more were carrying twigs.

First fly-out was at 6:24. Observed 2 groups flying out that we estimated at about 100 each and 3 groups of about 50, flying out in rapid succession (maybe 10-20 secs between fly-outs). About 10 min later there were 6 more groups of from 20-50 birds each, again in rapid succession. After that we counted another 30 or so males remaining in the reeds and singing. Total number was somewhere around 600.
