Recordings made using these devices resulted in faint sonograms, and pattern matching algorithms do not work well. Manual analysis of the recordings allowed for detection of vocalizations. This site was part of my first paper. When initially analyzed I noted some young birds in May when manually reviewing the site. Later Pattern Matching analysis did not match my manual analysis, so I have revisited all of these calls, and unfortunately my earlier analysis included errors in my assignment to hatchling and nestling as there was another non-trbl nestling that confused me. I have reviewed all of these calls and have corrected them. There are a handful of TRBL Hatchling and Fledgling calls May 1-3, but then they stop. So, there were either only a handful of nests that hatched any young. Thus, the first attempt in April/May was largely not even attempted. The few hatchlings that are heard are so few that I am unable to determine if they successfully fledged, or if they were abandoned. Susequently, there was a replacement pulse with the first bout in in May and the second bout in June, both of which successfully at producing fledglings. Unfortunately for the first bout there are a few days that coincide with hatching where the recording are unusable. The hatchling dates listed here in late May are potentially a day or two earlier than stated.

The female chatter seen in the pattern matching results is different than the template in that it is missing the lower range of the chatter. It is possible that these are not TRBLs but rather RWBLs, though the timing of the chatter coincides with the male chorus and the appearance of nestling calls. I have noted that female chatter seems different at site with RWBLs, though a careful analysis of this has not yet been done. It appears that the first attempt either never formed a colony or was abandened, though due to the distance from the recorder if there had been a small colony it might have gone undetected. The second attempt successfully prodced fledglings.",,Wendy,,,Site Description,,Wendy,,,,Solano County,2019 Leisure Town Road,,8075,38.31994,-121.938,27

Colony was too small to generate a male chorus, so incubation onset will need to be estimated at 11 days before hatch day. Unkown if nestlings survived to fledging as recordings stopped when they were only ~8 days old. There is a hint that there may have been an earlier attempt. I have one recording with YNC on 5/16/2022 and there is also a weak FS bout that correlates with this as well as a couple of FCs that imply a fledging date od 5/30. So I am betting that there was actually pulse 1 with hatch day before 5/16 and that these young fledged somewhere around/before 5/30. And there is a second round hatching around 5/27 and these would have fledged after the recordngs stopped. If this is the case, then this suggests a sub colony addition.

Male chorus continued until the first hatchlings were heard, and female chatter was heard for 13 days after the first hatchlings were heard, suggesting a continuous breeding form (Figure 3C, Table 3). The colony had a single bout of breeding that successfully produced young.
In addition to monitoring the colony through audio recordings, volunteers conducted several in-person visits (Table XX). In general, observations made during the visits aligned with the interpretation of breeding stages through analysis of the audio. Of note, volunteers saw fledglings dispersing on the same date that a large drop in fledgling calls was identified in the audio analysis, helping to confirm that the sharp drop in fledgling calls can be used to estimate dates of creche dispersal. ","This was highly asynchronous. The bulk of the nestlings hatch ~4/20ish. I suspect that this is a continuously nesting colony. Because of this I did a manual analysis. Also for MC, I just did three recordings/day every third day. I tagged a scattering of very young nestlings with YNC and older with MNC to show the lack of asynchrony. There might have been something that happened to the recording quality around May 14th in that recordings appear blank. But occassionally I get a recording with something in it, so it could just be a quiet site. UPDATE I went and filled in MC by examining every day from start to end of the first bout. It continues until 4/17. This happens to be 11 days before the last Female Chatter, so I think that there was continuous nesting initiation from until 4/17. Incubation would have been starting from 4/5 and continuously was initiation until 4/17.",2m,600,"Bulrush or tule (Schoenoplectus spp.), Cattails (Typha spp.)","Mature oak trees in proximity to the colony with some smaller shrubs less than 10 m away from the colony.

Based on Fledgling call alone a super tentative guess would be Fledging day of 6/17, whch would put hatch day at ~6/3, and incubation start at ~5/23. But this doesn't agree with ebird reports or field visits. Though it is just a few days off. If Food carries on 3/29 (in-person) was the date of hatching, and if on the longer end for fledgling (14days) then date of fledging would be 6/12.

Also, there is another nestling calling right at about hatching that is more repetitive and lower pitched, which could easily be mistaken for TRBL. I have makred a few of these with the tag non-TRBL. Because of this, my mapping of the edge will be wrong, as these fledglings will get counted as hatchlings in the summary software that Mike made for me. I need to update all recordings to have sp11 marked instead of alternate song, and change the software to count # of sp11-simple calls (hatchling only) instead of the Alternate Call which is a mmixture of hatchling/nestling/fledgling calls.

Last year's  colony site in the San Jacinto River channel was never irrigated, first due to a broken water line, but after it was fixed, no water was relegated to the site.

Male chorus continued until a few days after the first hatchlings were heard, and female chatter was heard weeks after the first hatchlings were detected, both of which indicate a continuous breeding pattern. The presence of nestling followed by fledgling begging calls was detected from mid-April continuously through mid-June. The presence of fledgling calls indicate this colony was successful.

Female chatter was not fully documented, as I confidently identified only 27 vocalizations of this kind throughout the season, instead of a hundred or more that are typically noted. While 2023 followed a similar breeding pattern, I was able to detect more female chatter in that year. One notable difference is that in 2023, male chorus ended right as hatchlings were first detected, whereas in 2024, male chorus extended well past the detection of the first hatchlings. Thus, in 2024, there was no period lacking male chorus or loud nestling calls, both of which can drown out the softer female chatter.
