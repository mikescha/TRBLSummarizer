Female Chatter is never heard, but there is almost continuous Male Chorus, and I can barely hear the young. Fledgling Begging Calls, being more strident, were picked up by the ARUs, and analysis of the Fledgling Begging Calls suggests there were two successful bouts of breeding, with the first bout starting with a small group which then had a larger Addition. This lead to the presence of Fledling Begging Calls from 1-May to 6-May (weak first bout), 22-May to 5-Jun (stronger Addition), and 21-Jun tp 24-Jun (Repeat). If this is correct, I can estimate the breeding stages as Bout #1: Incubation started ~6-Apr, Brooding ~16-Apr, and confirmed to have Fledged on 1-May and Dispersed 6-May. There was an addition to this first bout, with this addition starting to Incubate ~28-Apr, Brooding ~8-May, and was confirmed to have Fledged on 22-May and these fledglings hung around until 5-Jun. Once this first bout was completed, a Repeat bout was initiated and Incubation began ~27-May, Brooding ~7-Jun, and Fledging on 21-Jun and stuck around until 24-Jun, after which the majority of the Fledgling Begging Calls cease. There is a long tail of occasional Fledgling Begging Calls that extends through 27-Jul. I do not know if these are stragglers finishing up a really late breeding attempt, or if these are just fledglings that are re-visiting the area occasionally. Mini Manual was completed. 

ISSUE #1: None of the other results that I've reviewed are explicit about restating the dates like this. There's Table 4 in Results that have all the same information. It seems like either all of the sites should have this restated, or none should. 
ISSUE #2: The dates here are different than what's in Table 4. e.g. Table 4 has FBC from 24-May to 5-Jun, above it says 22-May to 5-Jun. Above says Incubation started 6-Apr, 28-Apr, and 27-May, but the table says Before, ND, and ND.

Some alternate wording for the first part: 
The ARU captured the colony poorly, and all vocalizations were faint. Female Chatter never occurred in the recordings, but Male Chorus was nearly continuous, and only faint vocalizations from young were audible. Fledgling Begging Calls, being more strident, carried into the recordings, and their timing suggests two successful bouts of breeding. The first bout began with a small group that was followed by a larger Addition.

ISSUE #3: Remove reference to REPEAT BOUT in the final text, replace with MULTIPLE somehow (could just be ""second"" and not reference the Multiple, since that word is in the first sentence of the stock paragraph.
ISSUE #4: ""Breeding Type"" in Col BV is ""Async"" but above mentions ""Repeat"" aka Multiple.
","This colony was [PLACEHOLDER: colony size]. The ARU was placed [PLACEHOLDER: ARU placement/duty cycle; note faint detections]. Female Chatter was not detected, but Male Chorus was nearly continuous. Fledgling Begging Calls indicated two main bouts of breeding: an initial weak effort followed by a stronger addition. A smaller third effort was also present. Fledgling Begging Calls extended through 27 July, likely representing stragglers or returning fledglings.

FS is never heard, but there is almost continuous chorus, and I can hear the young. I am betting that the young hatch multiple days before I pick them up on the recording. Analysis of the Fledgling Calls suggests there were two successful pulses, with the first pulse starting with a small group and then a larger sub-colony addition. This lead to a Fledling call from 5/1-5/6, 5/22-6/5, and 6/21-6/24. I can estimate the breeding stages as Pulse #1: There was a pulse that started incubating ~4/6, hatched ~4/16, and confirmed to have fledged on 5/1 - and these fledglings hung around for about until 5/6, so hung out for a total of 6 days. Since the recorder was placed on 4/14 I am unable to document the onset of incubation. Hatchlings are too far away to hear until they get a few days old. First nestlings are heard on  There was a sub-colony addition to this first pulse, with this addition starting incubation ~4/28, hatching ~5/8, and was confirmed to have fledged on 5/22 and these fledglings hung around until 6/5, or 15 days. When marking MC - looked for SOLID bands just above and below 2kHz, because of the distance of the chorusing at times, it looks underwhelming compared to other recordings which have Male Song at a closer distance, but they were not a SOLID band. Pulse #2: Once this first pulse was completed, a Replacement Pulse was initiated and incubation began ~5/27, hatching ~6/7, and this pulse fledged on 6/21 and stuck around until 6/24 for a total of 4 days, when the majority of the fledgling calls cease.

This second weak bout might have also shown a replacement for the sub-colony addition, though it was hard to document, as it was obscured by the vocalizations from the overlapping, and much larger bout of breeding from the first bout, but the presence of Fledgling Begging Calls into mid-June imply that this Replacement bout of at the orignal nesting sites, was also successful. Additionally, there is evidence that there was a Replacement bout of breeding at the Sub-colony Addition sites in that there are hatchlings heard on June 13, which is 28 days after the hatchlings from the first subcolony addition are heard.

I think that says they aren't in sync. Debi reports that the recorders ar ~100m apart. So, good news recorders agree with date/time/min. Bad news for triangulation they are not in sync at the seconds level. Fledgling dispersal was calculated by scanning thumbnails for a drop in consistent nestling chorus.

Since the brightness of the graphs are represent the relative abundance of detections per day, the Fledgling Begging Calls from this colony are very light on the graph. This difference in abundance also indicates that the nesting attempt at T27.2 was much larger than the later nesting attempt at this location.

These older birds are not the end of an earlier pulse in T27.1 because there is no evidence of Female Chatter, YNC, or MNC at all in the recordings evn though the recorder was placed with sufficient time to capture these vocalizations if they had been there. Therefore, I am only documenting a single pulse at this location, though because the ON from the other location are around, I need to document this as p2 to tease the two sets of nestlings apart. Additionally, there may be straggler p1 nestlings in the recordings as well, as they don't quite sound like fledglings to me in all of the recordings where I hear ONC when I ""shouldn't"". Interestingly, I believe that the birds from T27.2 have shifted their second attempt to T27.1 rather than do a replacement pulse in T27.2 and reusing previous nesting areas, thus the marking as p2 would be appropriate. The number of breeding birds is tiny in this pulse. By the end there are just a few straggling nestlings that can be heard to the end of the recordings. I did manage to document at least one fledgling on 7/27/2023 making the Fledgling calls, and I marked these as Simple Call 2 Present.

On 16-Apr it was reported that the pigs were removed and around 500 TRBL were present, but a coyote was seen. There was concern that the pigs might have created access tunnels for the coyotes and thus possible predation by the coyotes.

Asynchronous colony that had hints of pulses. Tried my best to document the rough dates of these pulses. Since the colony is aysnchronous these are very rough. After initial Male chorus, there is a scattering of male chorus later in the season, these are marked in the mini-manual analysis and I marked p2c and p3c as best I could to capture these. These other pulses are not as sustained as the first, and female song continues throughout this time. So while there may be other pulses within this colony, but they are not clearly definged. Nestling heard at the end, I think it is not a TRBL, I tagged them as ""other nestling"" and validated as TRBL nestling call not present. This other nestling has a doublet calls, and it seems less fuzzy and more compact than the TRBL nestling call. Might need to review these all again more carefully. I attempted to mark the 3 pulses even though the dates are a bit blurry due to overlapping pulses and lack of synchrony. The first pulse is smaller than the second, and the fledgling chorus is barely mutliple ONC, but I think I have it right. For feldgling/simple call 2 I am marking the dates with the louder full kHtz calls. UPDATE: By adding the Fledgling Call I think I have this teased out well.

",,"Sub-colony addition. After the first birds established a larger group appears to have joined them, resulting in overlapping breeding stages.  Based on density of nestling calls the second addition of birds was significanly larger than the first. The hatching date for the colony for pulse 1 is estimated, as the onset of pulse 2 Male Chorus drowns out the nestlings. So dates marked as nestling call not present when there is the loud male chorus are likely just because I can't hear them. When I do finally hear them, it is obvious that they are older nestlings. A few nestlings were heard on 5/17, and with most colonies the majority of hatching happens the day after first nestlings are heard, so I estimate that hatching date is ~5/18. The Fledgling dispersal date of pulse 1 is also an estimate as the calls from pulse 2 nestlings make it hard to determine the exact date. For recordings that were analyzed to determine the edge of hatching and dispersal (p1n, p2n) where the two pulaes overlapped I have marked the YNC with the tag YNC-p2 and the older nestling calls with ONC-p1 to distinguish between the two pulses of nestlings. I picked the p1 dispersal date on the day that seemed to have a lull in the ONC. There is a temporary lull in p2 nestling calls 6/12-6/13. There was also a rain storm on that day which maybe explains the lull.

Based on Fledgling call alone a super tentative guess would be Fledging day of 6/17, whch would put hatch day at ~6/3, and incubation start at ~5/23. But this doesn't agree with ebird reports or field visits. Though it is just a few days off. If Food carries on 3/29 (in-person) was the date of hatching, and if on the longer end for fledgling (14days) then date of fledging would be 6/12. Also, with feeding of Fladglings still seen on Aug, this could have been a continuous nesting site.
