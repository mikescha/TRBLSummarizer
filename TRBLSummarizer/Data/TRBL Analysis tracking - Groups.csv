Wind Wolves Preserve,,,,,"I have been working with the Wind Wolves preserve for four years, and with your help, I was able to deploy nine ARUs. Eight colonies were detected, all of which successfully fledged young. At one site, only a few male songs were detected, and no colony formed.","The Wind Wolves Preserve sites supported consistent and largely successful Tricolored Blackbird breeding across multiple years, with colonies forming at most monitored locations and all confirmed breeding attempts producing fledglings. Colony formation types varied among sites and years, including Simple, Asynchronous, and Complex structures, reflecting both single synchronous nesting attempts and prolonged or overlapping breeding activity. Several colonies initiated breeding prior to ARU deployment, indicating early site use, while others exhibited extended breeding periods characterized by sustained overlap of Female Chatter and Begging Calls. Despite variation in colony size and detectability, fledgling vocalizations provided clear confirmation of reproductive success at all occupied sites. No acoustic evidence of abandonment or weather-related failure was detected during the monitoring period. Collectively, these results indicate that Wind Wolves Preserve consistently provides suitable breeding conditions and supports repeated successful reproduction, while also illustrating the diversity of colony structures that can occur within a single protected landscape.",,"The Wind Wolves Preserve sites supported consistent Tricolored Blackbird breeding across multiple years and locations, with colonies exhibiting a range of formation types and uniformly successful outcomes. Breeding activity was detected at nearly all monitored sites, and all confirmed colonies produced fledglings, indicating that habitat conditions at Wind Wolves were sufficient to support reproduction during the study period.

Colony formation types at Wind Wolves were dominated by Asynchronous structures, with additional Simple and Complex colonies documented. Asynchronous breeding was characterized by prolonged overlap of Female Chatter with Nestling and Fledgling Begging Calls, indicating staggered nest initiation across breeding pairs. In one case, Complex structure reflected multiple temporally distinct breeding attempts with internal asynchrony, resulting in extended periods of fledgling activity. These patterns underscore the importance of extended acoustic monitoring for resolving overlapping and non-synchronous breeding activity that would be difficult to characterize through brief surveys.

Although early-stage vocalizations were weak or absent at some sites, particularly where colonies were small or breeding began prior to ARU deployment, Begging Calls from dependent young provided reliable indicators of reproductive success. Sustained Fledgling Begging Calls followed by abrupt declines allowed confident identification of dispersal and confirmation of successful outcomes even when early nesting stages were incompletely documented.

No acoustic evidence of abandonment or weather-driven failure was detected at Wind Wolves Preserve during the monitored years. This contrasts with patterns observed at some other regions in the dataset, where early nesting stages were more vulnerable to environmental stress. The consistency of successful outcomes at Wind Wolves suggests relatively stable breeding conditions across sites and years.

Overall, the Wind Wolves results align with broader patterns observed throughout the study area: colony structure is variable, asynchronous nesting is common, and Begging Calls provide the most robust acoustic indicators of reproductive outcome. Integrated with data from other regions, these findings contribute to a growing multi-year dataset that supports evaluation of breeding phenology, colony persistence, and drivers of reproductive success across the Tricolored Blackbird’s range."
Colusa NWR,,,,,,"Colusa NWR provides extensive managed wetland habitat that is used repeatedly by Tricolored Blackbirds late in the breeding season, often by birds dispersing from earlier nesting locations. Across years, acoustic monitoring documented substantial interannual variability in colony size, location, and timing, with colonies forming at one or both ponds in some years and no colonies forming in others. In multiple seasons, Fledgling Begging Calls were detected prior to the estimated onset of local Brooding, indicating that adults occasionally arrived with dependent young from earlier breeding attempts elsewhere. This pattern supports the interpretation that many Colusa NWR colonies represent later-season nesting bouts rather than primary early-season sites.

As at other sites, deployment timing and occasional recorder failure limited detection of some early or late breeding stages. Despite these constraints, the acoustic record was sufficient to reconstruct breeding chronology and determine outcomes for most attempts. Notably, bioacoustic data identified a heat-associated Partial Abandonment in 2024, characterized by an abrupt decline in colony activity shortly after the onset of Brooding during a period of extreme temperatures. Across years, these results highlight Colusa NWR as a dynamic landscape where colony establishment, success, and failure vary annually, and they demonstrate the value of ARUs for resolving breeding outcomes and movement patterns in a system where colonies shift spatially and temporally within the refuge.",,"Colusa NWR provides extensive wetland habitat used by Tricolored Blackbirds late in the breeding season, likely by birds dispersing from earlier nesting locations. The acoustic record shows considerable year-to-year variability in colony size and location, with colonies forming at one or both ponds in some years and no colonies forming in others. The presence of Fledgling Begging Calls prior to the onset of local Brooding at some sites indicates that adults occasionally arrive with fledglings from a previous attempt, further supporting the interpretation that many Colusa colonies represent later-season nesting bouts.

As at other sites, ARUs sometimes captured only part of the colony cycle when devices were deployed after nest initiation or failed before fledging. Despite these constraints, the recordings were sufficient to document breeding chronology and determine outcomes for most attempts, including identification of a heat-related Partial Abandonment in 2024.

These data will be integrated with records from other regions and years to evaluate breeding timing, outcomes, and formation types across the species’ range. Earlier statewide surveys relied on brief count windows and could not capture the full sequence of breeding stages. In contrast, continuous acoustic monitoring provides complete coverage of settlement, incubation, brooding, fledging, and dispersal, allowing detailed assessment of reproductive success and environmental drivers of failure.

Although the dataset offers broad geographic and temporal coverage, colonies nesting in agricultural fields remain under-represented due to access limitations. Because these fields support a substantial portion of the population, expanding monitoring in agricultural substrates remains a critical need for understanding breeding behavior across habitats.

Across sites, the acoustic record supports the five primary colony formation types and confirms the reliability of fledgling vocalizations for determining reproductive outcomes. Ongoing analyses are exploring how colony size, hydrological conditions, and weather events affect synchrony, success, and colony structure. The recordings further allow quantification of Partial Abandonment and provide insight into environmental disturbances, such as heat events, that influence colony outcomes.

Together, these results highlight the value of continuous ARU monitoring for characterizing Tricolored Blackbird breeding ecology at fine temporal resolution. The Colusa NWR dataset contributes essential information on late-season breeding, supports analysis of environmental influences on nesting outcomes, and provides a strong foundation for broader ecological and conservation assessments."
Monterey,,,,,,"The Monterey sites supported consistent Tricolored Blackbird breeding across multiple years and habitat types, with colonies exhibiting Simple, Multiple, and Asynchronous formation patterns and uniformly successful outcomes. All confirmed colonies produced fledglings, including those with faint acoustic signals or reduced detection of early-stage vocalizations. In several cases, particularly at Laguna Seca, early nesting activity was difficult to resolve acoustically; nevertheless, the duration and structure of Begging Calls were sufficient to reconstruct breeding chronology and confirm successful reproduction. Asynchronous colonies at Ohlone Pond showed prolonged overlap of Female Chatter with Nestling and Fledgling Begging Calls, indicating staggered nest initiation across breeding pairs. No acoustic evidence of abandonment or weather-driven failure was detected at Monterey sites, suggesting that conditions during the monitored years were sufficient to support successful breeding. Together, these results highlight the utility of ARU monitoring for resolving breeding outcomes and colony structure even at small, acoustically challenging, or partially obscured sites.",,"The Monterey sites documented a range of colony formation types, including Simple, Multiple, and Asynchronous structures, with consistently high reproductive success. All confirmed colonies produced fledglings, including those with faint acoustic signals or reduced detection of early-stage vocalizations. These results highlight the utility of ARU monitoring for resolving breeding outcomes even at small or acoustically challenging sites.

Multiple breeding attempts were observed at Laguna Seca, demonstrating that sequential nesting can occur even when vocalizations are weak and fledgling calls are not readily detectable. In such cases, the duration and timing of Nestling Begging Calls provide sufficient evidence to infer successful fledging. Asynchronous colony structures at Ohlone and Ohlone Pond further illustrate the diversity of breeding strategies within the region and the importance of extended monitoring to capture overlapping nesting activity.

Environmental conditions during the deployments did not result in detectable colony failure at Monterey sites. Rainfall events coincided with early Brooding at one site but were not associated with reductions in vocal activity or evidence of abandonment. These observations contrast with patterns observed at other locations in the broader dataset, where heat and precipitation have been linked to partial or complete breeding failure.

Although one deployment recorded no Tricolored Blackbird activity, the overall results indicate that Monterey County continues to support productive breeding colonies across a variety of wetland and managed habitats. Continued monitoring will be important for evaluating interannual variability, assessing responses to environmental conditions, and integrating these sites into regional analyses of breeding phenology and success."
Iron Point,,"Jennifer Brown, Emillie Graves, Dan Ariola",,,,"The Iron Point deployments document a site where Tricolored Blackbirds repeatedly initiate breeding but rarely complete it successfully. Across five monitored seasons, colonies established in three years, yet only one resulted in a clearly successful outcome, with another ending in Partial Abandonment and two seasons failing to establish colonies despite early vocal activity. This pattern suggests that Iron Point functions as a marginal or unstable breeding site rather than a consistently productive colony location. The nesting substrate is small and embedded within a highly modified suburban matrix, and construction activity occurred within close proximity during multiple years. Acoustic records show rapid declines in vocal activity following brief periods of nest initiation, consistent with early abandonment or reduced recruitment. Together, these observations indicate that repeated disturbance, limited habitat extent, or surrounding land-use pressures likely constrain colony persistence and reproductive success at this site, even though birds continue to prospect and attempt breeding there.",,"The Iron Point deployments illustrate a site where birds regularly initiate breeding but seldom complete it successfully. Of the five monitored seasons, only one resulted in successful fledging. The surrounding suburban environment, including ongoing construction adjacent to the breeding substrate, likely influences site stability and may contribute to repeated failures. These observations highlight the importance of understanding how disturbance and habitat modification affect colony persistence and reproductive outcomes. 

Iron Point Report for Chat

Data from these deployments will be integrated with records from other colonies and years to evaluate spatial and temporal patterns of Tricolored Blackbird breeding across the species’ range. Earlier efforts to assess colonies relied on short-duration surveys that did not capture complete breeding cycles. In contrast, continuous ARU deployments document full season-long activity and reveal the timing of success, failure, and abandonment at fine scale.

Despite strong geographic coverage, notable gaps remain due to limited access to privately owned agricultural fields, where a substantial proportion of the population breeds. Restricted access reduces opportunities to monitor colonies in these habitats and constrains comparisons across substrate types. Expanding monitoring in agricultural landscapes remains a priority for future work.

Even with access constraints, the Iron Point data contribute to the broader understanding of TRBL biology. The recordings reinforce the diagnostic value of breeding-stage vocalizations, provide examples of synchronous and asynchronous colony structures, and document abandonment patterns in disturbed landscapes. These findings also support the use of acoustic ratios and fledgling vocalizations for determining colony outcomes, enabling consistent classification across diverse sites.

Looking ahead, analyses integrating weather data, disturbance records, and acoustic signals may help identify environmental drivers of colony success or failure. Because ARUs capture the full soundscape, they can also provide insights into additional ecological factors, such as insect activity or seasonal changes in male vocalizations. Together, these data strengthen the foundation for long-term monitoring and conservation planning for Tricolored Blackbirds."
Markham Ravine,,"Tara, Charolette",,,,"Markham Ravine illustrates how Tricolored Blackbird colony establishment and success at a single site can vary markedly among years in response to environmental conditions. In 2018, a colony established adjacent to an active wetland construction project, and breeding was successful after construction activities were halted near the nesting area and the site was monitored in coordination with land managers. In 2019 and 2020, colonies again formed but exhibited Partial Abandonment, with declines in breeding activity coinciding with rain events during early nesting stages. No colony formed in 2021, a year characterized by severe drought conditions. In 2024, Tricolored Blackbirds were again absent during the deployment period; although the specific cause of non-occupancy is unknown, in-person visits noted a marked lack of insect activity at the site. Taken together, these results suggest that interannual variation in weather and food availability, rather than habitat restoration activities, likely played a primary role in determining colony establishment and outcomes at Markham Ravine. Acoustic monitoring provided a consistent record of these shifts, documenting both successful breeding when conditions were favorable and absence or failure when conditions were not.",,"Markham Ravine supported colonies in most monitored years, with breeding outcomes generally successful except for one partially abandoned attempt. In two deployments, no Tricolored Blackbirds were detected, reflecting annual variability in site occupancy typical of colonies in dynamic landscapes. Signal quality varied across deployments because two early ARUs used nonstandard devices, although manual review compensated for their limitations. When occupied, colonies produced clear acoustic signatures of breeding-stage transitions, enabling reliable reconstruction of chronology and outcomes.

These results contribute to broader multi-year datasets that integrate acoustic observations across the species’ range. Earlier region-wide assessments relied on brief count windows that did not capture complete breeding cycles. In contrast, continuous bioacoustic monitoring documents the full sequence of settlement, incubation, brooding, fledging, and dispersal, allowing detailed evaluation of reproductive timing, success, and failure.

Despite broad spatial and temporal coverage, gaps remain due to limited access to private lands and agricultural fields, which restricts representation of colonies in substrates where a large proportion of the population nests. This constraint reduces opportunities to compare breeding behavior across habitat types and may obscure differences in colony synchrony or vulnerability to environmental events. Expanding access to underrepresented substrates remains an important priority for future monitoring.

Across the sites analyzed, acoustic evidence supports the five primary colony formation types described for Tricolored Blackbirds and demonstrates the reliability of Begging Calls for determining reproductive outcomes. The recordings also reveal environmental and landscape factors that shape colony dynamics. At Markham Ravine, colony success generally occurred despite proximity to construction and agricultural activity, while rain events coincided with the only documented partial abandonment. These findings highlight the sensitivity of some breeding attempts to weather and disturbance.

Future work integrating these acoustic records with environmental datasets may clarify how disturbances, temperature fluctuations, or habitat change affect colony persistence and reproductive success. Because ARUs capture the complete soundscape, they offer additional opportunities to examine male vocal variation, insect activity, and other ecological factors relevant to colony performance. Together, the Markham Ravine data strengthen regional understanding of Tricolored Blackbird breeding ecology and contribute to a more comprehensive assessment of colony formation and outcomes across the species’ range."
Placer County,,Deren Ross,,,"Of the three colonies, one abandoned, one had a single bout of successful breeding, and the third had two waves of successful breeding. I have field notes for the 2021 season that complement the audio analysis.","The Placer County sites illustrate both the value of long-term field observations and the complementary role of acoustic monitoring in resolving colony outcomes. At Red Wing Ranch, acoustic data confirm the 2018 breeding failure, documented through post-season nest surveys, and the absence of breeding activity in 2019, supporting the interpretation that this site was abandoned early and not reused the following year. In 2021, Orchard Creek supported a large, productive colony with extended and overlapping breeding activity, consistent with in-person observations of staggered nesting, prolonged feeding, and visible fledglings. At Rodeo Grounds, in-person surveys documented a sharp decline in bird numbers following initial settlement, leading to uncertainty about whether the colony had fledged or failed. Acoustic analysis resolved this ambiguity by documenting a coherent sequence of Nestling and Fledgling Begging Calls, confirming successful reproduction from a small, synchronous breeding attempt despite low colony size and reduced visibility. Across sites, the close correspondence between in-person observations and acoustic results provides independent validation of the bioacoustic interpretations, while the Rodeo Grounds example demonstrates how ARU data can clarify breeding outcomes when visual observations alone are inconclusive due to distance, vegetation structure, or low activity levels.",,"The Placer County sites documented a range of colony formation types and breeding outcomes within a relatively small geographic area. Colonies included Simple and Additions structures, as well as one early abandonment. These results illustrate how colony organization and success can vary even among nearby sites and emphasize the importance of continuous monitoring for resolving outcomes that would be missed by brief field visits.

These data contribute to the broader multi-year dataset used to evaluate Tricolored Blackbird breeding phenology and success across the species’ range. In particular, the Additions colony at Orchard Creek provides a clear example of cohort-level synchrony occurring within a colony that is asynchronous at the site level. Such structures are difficult to identify without continuous acoustic records and highlight the diversity of breeding strategies employed by the species.

Several limitations were present. Early deployments used nonstandard recording devices that reduced detection quality, and some recorders were deployed after breeding had already begun, constraining the ability to resolve early stages. Despite these limitations, the presence and timing of Begging Calls were sufficient to determine colony outcomes at all occupied sites.

Across sites, the acoustic record reinforces the diagnostic value of dependent-young vocalizations for assessing reproductive success and failure. The abandoned attempt at Red Wing Ranch illustrates how abrupt loss of Begging Calls provides a clear acoustic signal of failure, even when early nesting stages are only partially documented. Conversely, sustained Fledgling Begging Calls reliably confirm success, regardless of colony size or structure.

Continued monitoring in Placer County will be valuable for assessing interannual variability, particularly in relation to weather and disturbance. Integrating these data with records from additional regions will further refine understanding of how colony formation type, environmental conditions, and landscape context interact to influence reproductive outcomes in Tricolored Blackbirds."
Solano County,,Wendy,,,,"The Solano County sites are among the most intensively monitored locations in this study, with multiple years of ARU deployments complemented by frequent in-person field visits conducted by experienced observers. This combination provides a strong opportunity to evaluate concordance between acoustic interpretations and direct observations across a range of colony sizes, formation types, and outcomes. Across sites and years, acoustic reconstructions of breeding chronology and outcome closely aligned with field observations, including timing of colony establishment, extended or asynchronous nesting activity, and fledgling dispersal. At repeatedly occupied sites such as Rush Ranch, Hay Landfill, Leisure Town Road, and Denverton Creek, acoustic data consistently resolved complex breeding structures, including Multiple and Additions colony types, that were difficult to characterize from episodic field visits alone. Partial and complete abandonment events identified acoustically were temporally consistent with rain and heat events noted during field visits, particularly during early nesting stages. Importantly, acoustic analyses were conducted independently of field notes, allowing later comparison without circular inference. Together, the Solano County sites demonstrate how integrating systematic acoustic monitoring with in-person observations improves confidence in breeding outcome determination and enhances resolution of colony dynamics in a landscape characterized by heterogeneous habitat and variable environmental conditions.",,"The Solano County sites documented a wide range of Tricolored Blackbird colony formation types and breeding outcomes across years. Colonies exhibited Simple, Multiple, and Complex structures, as well as years in which breeding was initiated but failed or did not occur. This variability highlights both the flexibility of breeding strategies within the region and the sensitivity of colony success to local conditions.

Multiple and Complex colony types were common at repeatedly occupied sites, particularly at Hay Landfill, Leisure Town Road, and Rush Ranch. These structures reflect sequential and overlapping nesting attempts within a single season and underscore the importance of extended acoustic monitoring for accurately resolving colony chronology. Without continuous coverage, Additions and closely spaced attempts could not be distinguished from asynchronous nesting or single extended attempts.

Abandonment and partial abandonment were observed at several sites and typically occurred during early nesting stages. In multiple cases, declines in vocal activity coincided with periods of environmental stress, including sustained high temperatures or precipitation events near the onset of Brooding. Although causal relationships cannot be confirmed acoustically, the timing of these declines is consistent with weather-associated breeding failure observed at other locations in the broader dataset.

Several deployments detected Tricolored Blackbirds without evidence of colony establishment. These detections likely represent prospecting or transient site use rather than active breeding. Continuous acoustic monitoring was essential for distinguishing these cases from failed breeding attempts and for preventing overestimation of colony occurrence.

Across sites, the presence and timing of Begging Calls from dependent young provided the most reliable indicators of reproductive outcome. Even when early-stage vocalizations were faint or when colonies were distant from recorders, Fledgling Begging Calls allowed confident classification of success. Conversely, abrupt loss of Begging Calls following early nesting stages provided clear acoustic evidence of failure.

Together, the Solano County results reinforce patterns observed elsewhere in this study. Colony structure is highly variable, breeding success is influenced by conditions during early nesting stages, and repeated monitoring across years is necessary to characterize site-level dynamics. Integrated with data from other regions, these findings contribute to a growing multi-year dataset that supports broader evaluation of breeding phenology, colony persistence, and drivers of reproductive success across the Tricolored Blackbird’s range."
Bob's Sites,,Bob,,,"The recorders that you placed were largely successful at capturing the vocalizations of the colonies. There were only a handful that had uncertain outcomes. For one the batteries failed. This was probably before I discovered the Duracell Optimum, and I know that in at least one of your units the batteries actuallly exploded in the case. There were a handful of times when the recorder was retrieved after the majority of the birds were done breeding, but there was a little ghost of a few birds that apparently were still nesting. These were minor issues, as the bulk of the breeding attempt was captured on the recordings.","The sites monitored by Robert Meese represent a unique component of this study, in that colony establishment, breeding chronology, and outcomes at many of these locations were already well characterized through extensive, long-term field monitoring by an experienced Tricolored Blackbird biologist. As a result, acoustic analysis added relatively little new interpretive insight regarding colony outcomes or causes of success and failure at these sites. Instead, the value of these deployments lies in demonstrating that ARU-based monitoring independently captured much of the same information obtained through detailed in-person visits, including timing of settlement, progression through breeding stages, identification of Multiple, Complex, and Asynchronous colony structures, and confirmation of fledging and dispersal.

Across sites, the acoustic record consistently documented breeding-stage transitions and outcomes that aligned with long-standing field observations. Where recorders spanned the full breeding cycle, fledging and dispersal were unambiguously identified through the onset and abrupt decline of Fledgling Begging Calls. At sites where recorders were deployed late or retrieved early, acoustic limitations mirrored those encountered during episodic field visits, reinforcing the importance of coverage duration rather than method alone. Partial Abandonment at 2022 Conaway East coincided with elevated temperatures during Incubation, consistent with weather-related impacts on nesting documented previously through field studies.

Taken together, these results demonstrate that ARUs can recover much of the biologically relevant information traditionally obtained through intensive field monitoring by expert observers. While they do not replace the depth of interpretation provided by long-term field experience, ARUs offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative for documenting breeding outcomes, colony structure, and timing at sites where sustained expert monitoring is not feasible. In landscapes where colonies are numerous, asynchronous, or geographically dispersed, acoustic monitoring provides a practical means of extending expert-level inference across a much broader spatial and temporal scope.",,"The Bob’s Sites deployments document a broad range of Tricolored Blackbird colony structures and breeding outcomes across multiple years and locations. Colonies varied widely in size, formation type, and success, reflecting both spatial heterogeneity in habitat conditions and temporal variability in breeding opportunities. Successful reproduction was common, but partial abandonment, complete abandonment, and uncertain outcomes were also observed, particularly where environmental conditions or recording coverage limited breeding progression.

Colony formation types included Simple, Multiple, Complex, Additions, and Asynchronous structures. Simple colonies with a single synchronous breeding attempt were most common, particularly at sites with clear and concentrated nesting activity. Multiple and Complex colonies were detected where sequential or overlapping breeding attempts occurred within a season, highlighting the importance of extended acoustic monitoring for resolving colony chronology. Without continuous coverage, closely spaced attempts and Additions could not be reliably distinguished from asynchronous nesting.

Abandonment and partial abandonment events were detected primarily during early nesting stages and were characterized acoustically by abrupt declines in Female Chatter and Begging Calls. In several cases, these declines coincided with periods of extreme heat or precipitation near the onset of Brooding. Although acoustic data alone cannot establish causation, the temporal alignment of these events with breeding failure is consistent with weather-associated impacts observed elsewhere in the dataset.

Several deployments detected Tricolored Blackbirds without evidence of colony establishment. These detections likely represent prospecting behavior or transient site use rather than active breeding. Continuous acoustic monitoring was essential for distinguishing these cases from failed breeding attempts and for preventing overestimation of colony occurrence.

Across sites, Begging Calls from dependent young provided the most reliable indicators of reproductive outcome. Even when early-stage vocalizations were weak, masked, or absent due to distance or colony size, sustained Fledgling Begging Calls followed by abrupt declines allowed confident identification of dispersal and confirmation of successful reproduction. Conversely, the absence or early loss of Begging Calls provided clear evidence of failure.

Overall, the Bob’s Sites results reinforce patterns observed throughout the broader study area. Colony structure is highly variable, breeding success is sensitive to conditions during early nesting stages, and repeated monitoring across years is necessary to characterize site-level dynamics. Integrated with data from other regions, these findings contribute to a growing multi-year dataset that supports evaluation of breeding phenology, colony persistence, and drivers of reproductive success across the Tricolored Blackbird’s range."
Baja,,Richard Erickson,,,,"The Baja sites represent the southernmost Tricolored Blackbird colonies monitored in this study and occupy a distinct portion of the species’ range, characterized by small, high-elevation marshes and localized wetland habitats. Across five independent deployments between 2022 and 2024, colonies were established at all monitored sites, and all documented breeding attempts resulted in successful fledging. Colony formation was dominated by Multiple breeding structures, with repeated, temporally discrete nesting bouts occurring at the same locations within a season. Although Male Chorus often persisted across breeding stages, discrete pulses of Hatchling, Nestling, and Fledgling Begging Calls allowed colony structure and outcomes to be reconstructed with confidence.

Several Baja deployments exhibited reduced detection of early-stage vocalizations, particularly Female Chatter, due to faint signal quality and masking by sustained Male Chorus. Despite this limitation, Fledgling Begging Calls were consistently detectable and provided a robust indicator of breeding success and timing of dispersal. At the Ciénega Redonda sites, overlapping fledgling vocalizations occasionally obscured precise fledging dates for later breeding attempts, but distinct declines in call abundance at regular intervals supported classification as Multiple rather than Asynchronous colonies. These patterns demonstrate the value of fledgling vocalizations for resolving breeding outcomes even when early nesting stages are poorly detected.

Notably, no acoustic evidence of weather-related failure, substrate disturbance, or abandonment was detected at any Baja site during the monitoring period. In contrast to several northern sites in the broader dataset, all breeding attempts documented in Baja were successful, suggesting relatively stable breeding conditions during the years monitored. While the small number of sites limits inference about regional drivers of success, these results indicate that Baja wetlands can support repeated breeding attempts within a single season.

Because these colonies occur outside the United States, their conservation presents unique management challenges. Further work integrating acoustic data with genetic sampling, banding, or coordinated monitoring across the international border could help determine whether Baja colonies function as a demographically distinct breeding group or are connected to the southernmost U.S. populations. In particular, future analyses of Male Song variation may provide insight into population structure and connectivity across this portion of the species’ range.",,"The Baja sites represent a distinct portion of the species’ range, spanning higher-elevation wetlands and localized riparian habitats. Across deployments, most colonies showed clear acoustic signatures of breeding-stage progression, and nearly all attempts resulted in successful fledging. Unlike some California interior sites, no weather-driven failures or substrate disturbances were detected acoustically, and the Baja colonies showed relatively stable seasonal activity. One site (2023 Rancho Cienega) had reduced signal quality that limited detection of early-stage vocalizations, but Fledgling Begging Calls were sufficient to reconstruct colony structure and assign outcomes.

Data from these sites will be integrated with records from other regions and years to evaluate breeding timing, synchrony, and outcomes across the species’ full range. Earlier region-wide surveys relied on brief population counts and therefore could not capture the complete breeding cycle. In contrast, this dataset incorporates continuous acoustic observations, enabling fine-scale documentation of breeding success, failure, and environmental conditions throughout an entire season. Ongoing analyses include assessing how heat, wind, and rainfall contribute to Abandonment events.

Although the broader dataset offers strong geographic and temporal coverage, important gaps remain. Colonies nesting in triticale or other agricultural fields continue to be underrepresented because gaining access to private land is challenging. These habitats support a significant share of the population, and expanding deployments in agricultural settings will be essential for evaluating whether breeding behavior differs across substrates.

Despite these limitations, the dataset advances understanding of Tricolored Blackbird biology. Evidence across sites supports five primary colony formation types and confirms that fledglings produce a distinct vocalization that allows outcomes to be inferred from sound alone. Ongoing analytical work is using this dataset to explore behavioral differences between small and large colonies, between dry and wet years, and between nesting substrates. The acoustic data also enable quantitative assessment of Partial Abandonment and fine-scale reconstruction of colony structure, including asynchronous nesting and the presence of Additional cohorts.

Future research can extend these findings by testing whether colonies adjust their timing in response to environmental change and whether projected increases in extreme weather may affect breeding success across the species’ range. Because the ARUs capture full soundscapes, additional studies may evaluate whether insect activity predicts breeding timing or whether variation in Male Song corresponds to population structure. These recordings provide opportunities for expanding both acoustic and ecological analyses beyond what traditional field methods can achieve."
San Jacinto Wildlife Area,,,,,,"The San Jacinto Wildlife Area supported repeated Tricolored Blackbird breeding activity across multiple years, but outcomes varied substantially among sites and years, reflecting both environmental sensitivity and disturbance exposure. Between 2018 and 2024, six of seven independent deployments documented colony establishment, with four successful breeding attempts and three abandonments. In 2018, two colonies initiated breeding but abandoned shortly after onset of Brooding; in both cases, abrupt cessation of vocal activity coincided with helicopter disturbance detected acoustically, suggesting acute disturbance as a likely driver of failure. In 2021, breeding again progressed to early Brooding before collapsing during an extreme heat event, consistent with heat-related abandonment during a vulnerable stage. In contrast, colonies in 2022, 2023, and 2024 successfully fledged young, including both Asynchronous and Multiple colony formation types, demonstrating that the site can support successful reproduction when conditions are favorable. Notably, the 2023 West of Davis deployment captured two temporally distinct successful breeding attempts, with the second involving fewer birds but still producing fledglings, illustrating intra-seasonal variability in colony size and effort. Together, these results highlight San Jacinto Wildlife Area as a site with recurring colony establishment but pronounced interannual sensitivity to disturbance and weather, underscoring the value of continuous acoustic monitoring for resolving both breeding outcomes and proximate causes of failure.",,"The San Jacinto Wildlife Area sites exhibited considerable variability in colony establishment and breeding outcomes across years. Although multiple colonies successfully produced fledglings, several breeding attempts were abandoned early, highlighting the sensitivity of colonies at this site to environmental and disturbance-related stressors. These patterns underscore the value of continuous acoustic monitoring for detecting both success and failure that would not be apparent from brief site visits.

Abandonment occurred during early breeding stages in multiple years, including failures coinciding with extreme heat and disturbance events. In contrast, the asynchronous colony documented in 2022 maintained extended breeding activity and successfully fledged young despite prolonged overlap of breeding stages. The Multiple colony west of Davis further illustrates the capacity for repeated successful nesting within a single season when conditions permit.

Although some deployments were limited in duration or began after breeding had already commenced, the presence or absence of Begging Calls provided reliable indicators of reproductive outcomes. These results reinforce the diagnostic value of dependent-young vocalizations for assessing colony success, even when early nesting stages are incompletely documented.

As with other regions, access limitations and variable deployment timing constrained the ability to resolve breeding chronology at some sites. Nevertheless, the San Jacinto dataset contributes important information to the broader multi-year analysis of Tricolored Blackbird breeding ecology, particularly regarding responses to heat and disturbance during early Brooding.

Together, these results demonstrate that ARU-based monitoring can effectively characterize colony formation types, detect abandonment events, and confirm successful reproduction across diverse and dynamic landscapes. Integrated with data from other regions, the San Jacinto findings strengthen understanding of the environmental drivers influencing Tricolored Blackbird breeding outcomes and support the use of bioacoustics as a scalable tool for conservation monitoring."
Dairies,,,,,,"The dairy-associated sites documented Tricolored Blackbird colonies nesting on private lands where landowners generously allowed limited ARU deployment. To protect landowner privacy, reported coordinates represent only approximate locations rather than exact colony sites. Across all deployments, colonies exhibited strongly Asynchronous breeding structure, with prolonged overlap among Female Chatter, Nestling Begging Calls, and Fledgling Begging Calls. This pattern reflects continual nest initiation and a lack of colony-wide synchrony, resulting in extended breeding periods rather than discrete nesting pulses. All three colonies successfully fledged young.

The pronounced asynchrony observed at these sites is consistent with well-documented patterns at large colonies nesting in substrates that are not spatially constrained, such as open agricultural fields, rather than in tightly bounded habitats like marshes or blackberry patches. Two of the three colonies were established in triticale, a substrate used by a substantial portion of the Tricolored Blackbird population. Although triticale-supported colonies are underrepresented in this study due to access limitations on private working lands, the breeding structure documented here aligns closely with long-standing field observations of staggered nest initiation and extended breeding activity in these open substrates.

At these large, asynchronous colonies, quieter vocalizations such as Female Chatter and early Begging Calls were occasionally masked by louder Tricolored Blackbird vocalizations, including Male Song, Male Chorus, and Fledgling Begging Calls. Despite this masking, dependent-young vocalizations provided clear and reliable confirmation of reproductive success, and the duration and continuity of fledgling vocal activity supported classification of these colonies as Asynchronous. Together, these deployments demonstrate that ARU-based monitoring can effectively document breeding structure and outcomes at large, spatially diffuse colonies on private agricultural lands, providing a practical complement to in-person monitoring in habitats that support a substantial portion of the species’ population.",,"The dairy-associated colonies exhibited strongly asynchronous breeding structure, with extended periods of overlap among Female Chatter, Nestling Begging Calls, and Fledgling Begging Calls. This pattern reflects continual nest initiation and a lack of colony-wide synchrony, consistent with what has been observed at other dairy and feedlot sites where food resources are abundant and habitat structure may promote dispersed nesting. All three colonies successfully fledged young.

These sites contribute to the broader multi-year dataset by extending representation of colonies nesting in agricultural and human-modified environments. Previous monitoring efforts focused primarily on natural wetlands or seasonal grain fields and did not fully capture breeding behavior in dairy landscapes. The continuous acoustic data from these deployments document full breeding-stage transitions, offering insight into how colony structure differs in environments with persistent disturbance, anthropogenic noise, or nontraditional substrates.

As in other regions, some limitations were inherent to the placements. Heavy machinery and livestock noise occasionally masked faint vocalizations, and the large spatial footprint of dairy properties means that ARUs may capture only a subset of the active nesting area. Despite these constraints, vocalization patterns were sufficiently clear to identify colony type and outcome at all three sites.

Across sites, the data reinforce the reliability of fledgling vocalizations for determining reproductive outcome and support the broader framework of colony formation types, including Asynchronous colonies characterized by extended and overlapping nesting activity. The dairy colonies provide additional evidence that asynchronous timing is most common in landscapes with abundant food or complex structural features, where birds may initiate nests independently rather than in coordinated pulses.

Future work may examine how conditions at dairy sites—such as food availability, substrate type, disturbance frequency, or microclimate—shape colony synchrony and reproductive outcomes. Because ARUs capture soundscapes continuously, they provide an opportunity to assess how Tricolored Blackbirds adjust breeding behavior in environments with persistent anthropogenic activity. These data help integrate dairy-associated colonies into the broader understanding of Tricolored Blackbird breeding ecology and strengthen the comparative analysis across habitat types."
Merced and San Luis NWR,,,,,,"Breeding outcomes at the Merced and San Luis NWR sites varied markedly among locations and were strongly shaped by substrate condition and mid-season colony attrition. Acoustic analysis identified multiple Partial Abandonments and one full Abandonment, patterns that closely align with independent in-person observations made during the same period. At Deadman Wetland Ditch and Fiddleneck Lake, sharp declines in Female Chatter followed by sparse and short-lived Nestling Begging Calls indicated early failure or substantial loss of nests, while limited or absent Fledgling Begging Calls suggested that few young survived to fledging. Field visits documented rapid colony decline, widespread nest loss associated with desiccation and wind-damaged milkthistle, and dramatic reductions in bird numbers within weeks of peak nest building, corroborating the acoustic signatures of Partial Abandonment. In contrast, Tanager Slough supported successful reproduction despite partial losses in milkthistle substrates, consistent with the presence of sustained Fledgling Begging Calls and field observations of fledglings in willow-dominated areas. Notably, the correspondence between acoustic classifications and observer notes emerged after the bioacoustic analysis had been completed, providing independent validation that the detected declines in vocal activity accurately reflect real colony outcomes. Together, these results demonstrate that ARU-based monitoring can reliably capture partial and complete breeding failures driven by habitat degradation and environmental stressors, even when colonies persist at low density or shift breeding effort among adjacent substrates.",,"The Merced and San Luis NWR sites exhibited substantial variability in colony formation and breeding outcomes. Colonies ranged from fully successful attempts to early abandonment and partial abandonment, reflecting sensitivity to local conditions during the breeding season. Several sites showed evidence of brood loss after hatching, emphasizing the value of continuous acoustic monitoring for detecting failures that would not be apparent from brief surveys.

These results contribute to the broader multi-year dataset documenting Tricolored Blackbird breeding ecology across the Central Valley. Traditional survey methods capture only a snapshot of colony activity, whereas ARU deployments document complete breeding cycles, allowing fine-scale reconstruction of nesting chronology and outcomes. The presence of Multiple and Asynchronous colony structures at these sites further highlights the diversity of breeding strategies within the region.

Environmental stressors appear to play an important role in shaping outcomes at these refuges. Partial abandonment at multiple sites coincided with periods of elevated temperature, consistent with patterns observed elsewhere in the dataset. These findings suggest that heat events may disproportionately affect small or late-initiated colonies, reducing fledging success even when breeding has progressed beyond incubation.

Despite the strong coverage provided by ARUs, some limitations remain. Detection of early-stage vocalizations was reduced at sites with low signal quality or when recorders were deployed after nesting had begun. In addition, colonies nesting in agricultural substrates outside refuge boundaries remain underrepresented due to access constraints, limiting direct comparison across all habitat types used by the species.

Across sites, the acoustic record supports the five primary colony formation types and confirms the diagnostic value of Begging Calls for determining breeding outcomes. Continued integration of these data with environmental variables will allow more rigorous evaluation of how weather, habitat conditions, and colony structure interact to influence reproductive success. Together, the Merced and San Luis NWR results strengthen regional understanding of Tricolored Blackbird breeding dynamics and provide critical context for conservation planning in managed wetland systems."
Washington,Washington State,"Fidorra, Jason C",Jason.Fidorra@dfw.wa.gov,,"ARUs were deployed at two sites over the course of three years. All three years successfully fledged young at both sites. Interestingly, in both 2023 and 2024, TRBLs nested first at McCain wetlands and then at McCain Wetlands. The timing is consistent with the birds finishing their nesting at McCain Wetlands and then moving to Harder Springs for a second round of breeding.","The Washington State sites represent the northern extent of the monitored range and provide a rare multi-year view of Tricolored Blackbird breeding dynamics in small, isolated wetland systems. Across three years, colonies were established at both McCain Wetlands and Harder Spring, and all deployments documented successful fledging. Despite relatively small colony sizes and reduced detectability of early-stage vocalizations at several deployments, fledgling begging calls provided consistent confirmation of reproductive success. Colony formation types varied among years and sites, including Simple, Multiple, Additions, and Asynchronous structures, demonstrating that a broad range of breeding strategies occurs even at the edge of the species’ range.

Notably, in all three years, breeding activity was detected earlier at McCain Wetlands than at Harder Spring, with the timing of fledging and subsequent colony establishment consistent with birds completing a breeding attempt at McCain before the attempt at Harder Spring. While individual movement between sites cannot be confirmed from acoustic data alone, the repeated temporal sequence across years suggests that the same birds may be using both locations, and there is coordinated use of nearby wetlands rather than independent colony dynamics. This pattern aligns with historical observations that Tricolored Blackbirds may relocate between breeding attempts within a season and highlights the value of continuous acoustic monitoring for identifying such sequential use of habitats.

Together, these sites illustrate how ARU data can resolve fine-scale temporal relationships among nearby colonies, even when colonies are small, habitats are acoustically complex, and traditional field access is limited. Continued monitoring at both locations, ideally combined with banding or telemetry, would help determine whether the same individuals are using multiple sites within a season and clarify how breeding decisions are structured at the northern edge of the species’ distribution.",,"The Washington State sites represent the northernmost extent of Tricolored Blackbird breeding documented in this study and provide insight into colony structure and reproductive outcomes at the edge of the species’ range. Across years, colonies formed consistently at both monitored sites and successfully produced fledglings, despite relatively small colony sizes and short breeding seasons.

Colony formation types in Washington included Simple, Multiple, Additions, and Asynchronous structures. Multiple breeding attempts were documented at Harder Spring in more than one year, indicating that sequential nesting within a single season can occur even at northern latitudes. Asynchronous breeding was also detected, particularly when ARU deployments began after breeding was already underway, resulting in overlapping acoustic signals from different breeding stages.

In several cases, early-stage vocalizations such as Male Chorus or Female Chatter were weak or absent, likely due to low colony size, distance from the recorder, or timing of deployment. Despite these limitations, Begging Calls from dependent young provided reliable indicators of reproductive success. Sustained Fledgling Begging Calls followed by abrupt declines allowed confident identification of dispersal and confirmation of successful breeding outcomes, even when earlier stages were incompletely documented.

No acoustic evidence of colony abandonment or weather-driven failure was detected at the Washington sites. All documented breeding attempts progressed through fledging, suggesting that conditions at these sites were sufficient to support successful reproduction during the monitored years. These results contrast with patterns observed at some interior and southern sites, where early abandonment and partial abandonment were more common.

Overall, the Washington results reinforce the value of acoustic monitoring for documenting breeding activity at range margins, where colony sizes are small and traditional survey methods may be less effective. Integrated with data from other regions, these findings contribute to a broader understanding of Tricolored Blackbird breeding phenology, colony structure, and reproductive success across diverse ecological contexts."
Oregon,,,,,,"The Oregon sites supported small but productive Tricolored Blackbird colonies, with successful breeding documented at four of six deployments. Colony formation types included Simple, Multiple, and Asynchronous structures, demonstrating that a range of breeding strategies occurs even at the northern edge of the species’ monitored range. Colony sizes were generally small, and Male Chorus was often weak or absent, likely reflecting both limited numbers of birds and detection constraints. Despite this, Begging Calls from dependent young provided clear and reliable evidence of reproductive success. In one case, a Partial Abandonment coincided with a brief period of elevated temperature and precipitation, consistent with weather-associated impacts observed elsewhere in the dataset. Together, these results show that ARU monitoring can resolve breeding outcomes and colony structure even where vocal activity is sparse and colonies would be difficult to assess through brief field visits alone.",,"The Oregon sites supported small but productive Tricolored Blackbird colonies, with successful breeding documented at four of six deployments. Colony formation types included Simple, Multiple, and Asynchronous structures, demonstrating that a range of breeding strategies occurs at the northern edge of the species’ monitored range. Although colony sizes were generally small and Male Chorus was often weak or absent, fledgling vocalizations provided clear evidence of reproductive success.

These results contribute to the broader multi-year dataset used to evaluate breeding phenology and outcomes across the species’ range. Traditional survey methods provide only brief snapshots of colony status, whereas continuous acoustic monitoring captures the full breeding cycle, allowing identification of partial abandonment and sequential breeding attempts that would otherwise go undetected.

Environmental conditions appear to have influenced outcomes at some Oregon sites. Partial abandonment at the Dizney Road site coincided with periods of elevated temperature and reduced vocal activity during Brooding, consistent with patterns observed elsewhere in the dataset. In contrast, Asynchronous colonies at Oregon 2 and Eureka Road maintained extended breeding activity and successfully fledged young despite faint early-stage detections.

Although the number of Oregon deployments was limited, these data demonstrate the effectiveness of ARUs for documenting breeding outcomes at small or acoustically challenging colonies. Continued monitoring in this region will be important for assessing interannual variability, evaluating sensitivity to weather extremes, and integrating northern sites into broader analyses of Tricolored Blackbird breeding ecology."
Los Vaqueros,,,,"The fully abandoned colony at the 2023 Los Vaqueros Walnut Trail site coincided with a sharp temperature increase during the onset of Brooding. At the 2024 Los Vaqueros site, feral pigs disrupted the nesting substrate before the first breeding attempt. Although the first attempt was classified as Partial Abandonment, the timing of the disturbance suggests it was not the cause. ",,"The Los Vaqueros colony has been monitored across multiple seasons by volunteers from the Mount Diablo Bird Alliance, providing a valuable longitudinal context that includes years of successful breeding, partial abandonment, and delayed colony initiation. Regular site visits yielded observations of colony size, fledgling presence, and potential disturbances, offering independent context for interpreting the acoustic record despite the episodic nature of volunteer monitoring.

In one season, feral pigs disrupted the nesting substrate early in the breeding period, raising concern that this disturbance contributed to the weak initial breeding attempt. Volunteer observations led to rapid reporting and removal of the pigs, limiting the duration of the disturbance. Acoustic data show that Male Chorus continued uninterrupted through and after this event, and subsequent vocal patterns were consistent with colony persistence and successful fledging. This suggests that the disturbance, while potentially consequential if left unaddressed, was unlikely to have been the primary driver of reduced early breeding effort.

Across other seasons at Los Vaqueros, acoustic data documented a range of outcomes, including years with stronger early nesting activity and years characterized by delayed initiation or partial abandonment. Notably, the season with the pig disturbance coincided with a broader regional pattern of slow colony establishment during a colder-than-normal start, indicating that weather conditions likely played a more substantial role than localized disturbance in shaping early breeding dynamics.

Taken together, the Los Vaqueros results illustrate how multi-year acoustic monitoring can place individual disturbance events within a broader temporal framework. By resolving fine-scale changes in vocal activity across seasons, ARUs allow coincident stressors—such as weather anomalies and substrate disturbance—to be evaluated relative to baseline site behavior, complementing volunteer observations and improving confidence in interpretations of breeding outcome.",Mount Diablo Bird Alliance,Written
CNLM,,,,,,"Breeding activity at CNLM sites varied among years and locations, with colonies establishing at some sites while others were visited briefly before birds moved on. Because many colonies were detected after Settlement had begun, ARUs were frequently deployed after early breeding stages, limiting detection of Male Chorus and early Female Chatter. Despite this constraint, the acoustic record was sufficient to confirm colony establishment and reconstruct breeding chronologies for nearly all active sites. All established colonies were successful except for one partially abandoned breeding attempt.

At several sites, the acoustic analysis independently resolved breeding timing with a precision that was later corroborated by in-person observations. At the 2023 Panoche Creek Preserve Corrals site, extremely faint Hatchling Begging Calls were detected in the first recordings, indicating that hatching had occurred shortly before ARU deployment. Subsequent review of photographs taken on the deployment date confirmed the presence of newly hatched chicks, providing strong validation that the earliest begging vocalizations accurately marked hatch timing to within one to two days. Notably, this confirmation occurred after the acoustic analysis had been completed, underscoring the reliability of these vocal cues for reconstructing breeding chronology even when colonies are discovered late or access is limited.",,"Breeding activity at CNLM sites varied from year to year, with colonies forming in some locations while others were only briefly visited by birds before they moved on. Because colonies were generally discovered after settlement had begun, ARUs were often placed after early breeding stages had passed, limiting detection of Male Chorus and early Female Chatter. Despite these constraints, the acoustic record was sufficient to document colony establishment and reconstruct breeding chronologies for nearly all active sites. All established colonies succeeded except for one partially abandoned attempt.

These results will be integrated with regional datasets spanning multiple years to evaluate breeding timing, success rates, and colony formation patterns across the species’ range. Traditional monitoring has relied on short survey windows that capture only a portion of the breeding season, but the CNLM deployments illustrate the value of continuous acoustic monitoring for documenting the full sequence of breeding stages. This expanded coverage enables fine-scale assessment of breeding success, failure, and associated weather conditions.

As with other regions, some important gaps remain. Colonies that nest in agricultural substrates continue to be under-represented, in part because access to private lands is limited. This is a critical gap given the large proportion of the population that uses agricultural habitats. Increasing deployment opportunities in such areas would allow more comprehensive evaluation of whether breeding dynamics differ across substrates.

Despite these limitations, the dataset strengthens biological understanding of Tricolored Blackbirds. Acoustic evidence across sites supports the five primary colony formation types and highlights the consistency of fledgling vocalizations, enabling accurate identification of reproductive outcomes. Continued analyses are exploring how colony size, year-to-year conditions, and environmental events shape breeding patterns across the species' range. These recordings also allow quantification of Partial Abandonment, documentation of cross-species interactions, and evaluation of heat- or wind-related disruptions during sensitive breeding stages.

Future work may examine whether CNLM colonies adjust breeding timing in response to environmental variation, whether projected increases in extreme weather may affect reproductive outcomes, and how insect acoustic activity correlates with breeding stage transitions. Because ARUs capture the complete soundscape, they offer opportunities to investigate male vocal variation and evaluate potential links to population structure. Together, these results demonstrate that continuous ARU monitoring provides a powerful, non-invasive tool for characterizing TRBL breeding ecology at resolutions unattainable through site visits alone."
Southern Sierra Research Station,,,,,,"The Southern Sierra Research Station sites captured substantial heterogeneity in Tricolored Blackbird site use and breeding outcomes across a relatively small geographic area. Of ten deployments between 2021 and 2024, five sites supported colony establishment and successful breeding, while others showed intermittent presence without breeding or complete absence of birds. Where colonies formed, breeding strategies ranged from Simple to Multiple and Complex, including one site with two clearly separated successful breeding attempts within a single season. Several colonies were extremely small, resulting in weak or infrequent detections of Female Chatter and early-stage Begging Calls; however, manual review confirmed that even sparse acoustic signals were sufficient to reconstruct breeding chronology and determine outcomes. One site exhibited Partial Abandonment following early Brooding, while another showed rapid cessation of all vocal activity consistent with Abandonment, underscoring the sensitivity of acoustic monitoring to early failure events. In contrast, sites with no detected breeding activity were characterized by sporadic Male Song without progression to Female Chatter or Begging Calls, indicating that birds assessed but did not initiate nesting. Together, these results illustrate how ARU monitoring can distinguish among absence, prospecting, breeding initiation, success, and failure across sites with low colony density and challenging acoustic conditions, providing resolution that would be difficult to achieve through infrequent field visits alone.",,"The Southern Sierra Research Station sites documented limited but informative Tricolored Blackbird breeding activity within the southern extent of the species’ monitored range. Across deployments, colonies were small and often weakly established, with a mixture of successful, partially abandoned, and failed breeding attempts. These results illustrate both the capacity for reproduction in this region and the vulnerability of colonies to local conditions.

Colony formation types were predominantly Simple or Multiple, with one Complex colony detected. Asynchronous breeding was limited and, where present, occurred at low intensity relative to dominant synchronous nesting. This pattern contrasts with some larger interior valley sites and suggests that breeding activity in the Southern Sierra may be constrained by habitat configuration, colony size, or environmental conditions that limit prolonged recruitment.

Several sites supported breeding attempts that failed early or were partially abandoned. These failures generally occurred during or shortly after Brooding and were characterized acoustically by brief or weak Begging Call detections followed by rapid declines in activity. In some cases, breeding-stage timing could not be resolved precisely due to sparse detections or abbreviated deployments, underscoring the importance of extended recording coverage for small or acoustically challenging colonies.

In contrast, sites that supported successful breeding exhibited clear and temporally distinct Begging Call sequences, even when colony size was small. In these cases, Fledgling Begging Calls provided the most reliable indicators of reproductive success, reinforcing their diagnostic value for outcome classification when early-stage vocalizations are faint or inconsistently detected.

Several deployments detected Tricolored Blackbirds without evidence of colony establishment. These detections likely represent prospecting behavior or transient use of habitat rather than active breeding. Continuous acoustic monitoring was essential for distinguishing these cases from failed nesting attempts and for preventing overestimation of breeding occurrence in the region.

Overall, the Southern Sierra results align with broader patterns observed across the study area: colony size and structure vary widely, breeding success is sensitive to conditions during early nesting stages, and repeated monitoring across years is necessary to characterize site-level dynamics. Integrated with data from other regions, these findings contribute to a growing multi-year dataset that supports broader evaluation of breeding phenology, colony persistence, and drivers of reproductive success across the Tricolored Blackbird’s range."
Rancho Jamul,,,,,,"The Rancho Jamul sites consistently supported productive Tricolored Blackbird colonies across multiple years, with five of six independent deployments documenting successful breeding and a total of seven successful breeding bouts. Colony formation types were diverse, including Simple, Asynchronous, Multiple, and Complex structures, indicating both temporal flexibility and repeated site use. Several colonies exhibited overlapping breeding stages or multiple nesting bouts within a season, patterns that were clearly resolved through acoustic data even when early-stage vocalizations were faint or partially masked by background noise. Notably, fledgling begging calls provided unambiguous confirmation of reproductive success at all successful sites, including cases where early nesting activity was weak or distant from the recorder. In contrast, one deployment documented only limited male song without subsequent Female Chatter or begging calls, indicating presence without colony establishment. Together, these results demonstrate that Rancho Jamul provides reliable breeding habitat across years, while also illustrating the value of continuous acoustic monitoring for distinguishing true colony establishment from transient site use and for resolving complex or asynchronous breeding dynamics that would be difficult to characterize through intermittent field visits alone. ",,"The Rancho Jamul sites documented a high frequency of successful Tricolored Blackbird breeding across multiple years, with colonies exhibiting Simple, Multiple, Asynchronous, and Complex formation types. This diversity of colony structures within a single landscape highlights the flexibility of breeding strategies employed by the species and underscores the value of continuous acoustic monitoring for resolving overlapping and sequential nesting attempts.

Several colonies showed extended or overlapping breeding activity that would have been difficult to characterize through brief field visits alone. In particular, the Asynchronous and Complex colonies produced prolonged periods of mixed vocalization stages, emphasizing the importance of long-duration deployments for accurately reconstructing breeding chronology and outcomes. The detection of multiple successful breeding bouts at the same sites across years further indicates that Rancho Jamul provides consistently suitable conditions for reproduction.

Acoustic interference from sympatric species, particularly Red-winged Blackbirds, reduced detection quality at some sites but did not prevent determination of colony outcomes. In these cases, Begging Calls from dependent young provided the most reliable indicators of success. These results reinforce the diagnostic value of Fledgling Begging Calls for confirming reproductive outcomes, even when early-stage vocalizations are weak or masked.

Although two deployments did not support colony formation, birds were present in the surrounding area, suggesting that site use may vary among years or that local conditions influenced settlement decisions. Continued monitoring at Rancho Jamul will allow evaluation of interannual variability in colony establishment, breeding structure, and success, and will contribute to broader analyses examining how environmental conditions and landscape context influence reproductive outcomes across the species’ range."
Sedgwick,Sedgwick Preserve,Heather,,,,"The Sedgwick Preserve colonies present a distinct acoustic context compared to many other monitored sites. Colonies at this location are relatively small and co-occur with Red-winged Blackbirds, whose vocalizations can overlap with or mask Tricolored Blackbird calls. In addition, Sedgwick periodically exhibits prolonged or near-continuous breeding activity, resulting in extended overlap of loud vocalizations such as Male Chorus and Fledgling Begging Calls. Together, these factors reduce detectability of quieter vocalizations, particularly Female Chatter, and complicate precise resolution of early breeding stages.

Despite these challenges, all four deployments documented colony establishment, and three years confirmed successful fledging. Colony formation types were consistent across years, with Multiple nesting detected in one year and Asynchronous nesting in others. In 2023, in-person monitoring independently documented nest building, fledgling presence, and dispersal, and these observations closely aligned with acoustic interpretations, including the timing of fledgling dispersal inferred from a sharp decline in Fledgling Begging Calls. Notably, acoustic analyses were conducted without reference to field notes, providing independent confirmation of breeding outcomes and stage transitions.

Across years, no acoustic evidence of disturbance, predation, or weather-driven failure was detected at Sedgwick Preserve. The site’s protected status and access to surrounding foraging habitat likely contribute to its repeated use and relatively stable breeding outcomes. Continued acoustic monitoring, supplemented by periodic field observations, will improve resolution of early-stage vocalizations and help clarify whether the colony’s recurrent asynchronous structure reflects local habitat conditions, colony size, or intrinsic breeding dynamics.",Sedgwick Reserve,"The Sedgwick Preserve colonies exhibited consistent annual use of the site and supported successful breeding in most years. Colony formation types varied among years, with Multiple nesting observed in one year and Asynchronous nesting in others. This interannual variation highlights the flexibility of breeding strategies employed by Tricolored Blackbirds and underscores the importance of multi-year monitoring for characterizing site-level dynamics.

Although colony size at Sedgwick was smaller than at some other monitored sites, acoustic data were sufficient to resolve breeding structure and outcomes in all but one year. Masking of quieter vocalizations, particularly Female Chatter, occurred when Male Chorus or Begging Calls were intense, but these limitations did not prevent determination of colony outcomes. In each successful year, Fledgling Begging Calls provided clear confirmation of reproduction.

The incomplete outcome in 2021 illustrates the importance of deployment duration. When recording coverage does not extend through fledging, outcomes cannot be reliably assigned even when early breeding stages are well documented. In contrast, extended deployments in subsequent years captured complete breeding cycles, allowing confident classification of colony type and success.

Across years, no acoustic evidence of disturbance or weather-driven failure was detected at Sedgwick Preserve. The site’s protected status and surrounding foraging habitat likely contribute to its repeated use and relatively stable breeding outcomes. Continued acoustic monitoring will be valuable for assessing whether the observed asynchronous structure reflects local habitat conditions, colony size, or broader regional trends.

Integrated with data from other regions, the Sedgwick results contribute to a growing multi-year dataset that documents the full breeding cycle of Tricolored Blackbirds. These findings reinforce the utility of ARU-based monitoring for resolving colony structure, detecting sequential and asynchronous breeding, and confirming reproductive outcomes in situations where traditional field methods provide only limited temporal coverage."
San Bernardino,,,,,,"The Newberry Springs sites illustrate both the utility and the limitations of bioacoustic monitoring when access is constrained. Deployment at this location was necessarily brief due to restrictions imposed by the local Homeowners Association, which limited recorder placement to short windows late in the breeding season. Despite this constraint, acoustic evidence confirmed successful reproduction in two years, as indicated by the presence of Fledgling Begging Calls. Because recorders were deployed after early nesting stages and retrieved before dispersal, breeding chronology and colony formation type could not be resolved and were therefore classified as Unknown. These results demonstrate that even short-duration deployments can reliably confirm reproductive success, while also highlighting that limited access reduces the ability to characterize breeding structure, timing, and potential disturbances. The Newberry Springs sites thus provide a clear example of how ARU monitoring can extract biologically meaningful outcomes under access limitations, while reinforcing the value of longer deployments where feasible.",,"The San Bernardino sites documented limited but successful Tricolored Blackbird breeding activity. Two colonies produced fledglings despite abbreviated deployments that constrained resolution of breeding chronology. These results illustrate the value of fledgling vocalizations for determining reproductive outcomes when early nesting stages are not acoustically captured.

Although breeding-stage timing could not be reconstructed at either successful site, the presence of Fledgling Begging Calls provided unequivocal evidence of success. In contrast, sites where only Male Song was detected did not progress into breeding, demonstrating the utility of acoustic criteria for distinguishing site use from colony establishment.

These data contribute to the broader multi-year dataset examining Tricolored Blackbird breeding across the species’ range. Continuous acoustic monitoring offers a clear advantage over brief site visits by enabling outcome determination even when deployment windows are short or access is limited. The San Bernardino results reinforce the importance of extended deployments for resolving breeding chronology, while also highlighting that partial datasets can still yield reliable outcome classifications.

Several limitations were present. Restricted deployment durations limited the ability to determine colony formation type at successful sites, resulting in classification as Unknown. In addition, colonies nesting in agricultural or private substrates remain under-represented due to access constraints. Expanding monitoring coverage in these habitats will be essential for fully characterizing breeding behavior across environmental contexts.

Across all San Bernardino deployments, the acoustic record supports the diagnostic value of Begging Calls for determining reproductive success and confirms the robustness of ARU-based monitoring for sites that receive limited or infrequent field visitation. Integrated with data from other regions, these results strengthen understanding of breeding outcomes and support broader analyses of environmental drivers influencing Tricolored Blackbird reproduction."
