Wind Wolves Preserve,,,,"I have been working with the Wind Wolves preserve for four years and with your help I was able to deploy nine ARUs. Eight colonies were detected, all of which successfully fledged young. At one site, only a few male songs were detected, and no colony formed.","To date, the colonies that form at your site are successful. First hatchlings are consistently detected the first week in May. In 2024, breeding started earlier, and there was even a second bout of breeding at Pleitito. This was the first site where I noted the male song that has the uprising clear note at the beginning. I have since located this version of male song at other locations, though not at the abundance as at your site.",,

Bob's Sites,,Bob,,"The recorders that you placed were largely successful at capturing the vocalizations of the colonies. There were only a handful that had uncertain outcomes. For one the batteries failed. This was probably before I discovered the Duracell Optimum, and I know that in at least one of your units the batteries actuallly exploded in the case. There were a handful of times when the recorder was retrieved after the majority of the birds were done breeding, but there was a little ghost of a few birds that apparently were still nesting. These were minor issues, as the bulk of the breeding attempt was captured on the recordings.","As I have analyzed more colonies, I have found a relatively messy world. But if you take the four main ways a colony forms, and then map the predicted vocalization patterns of colonies in Figure 2 to generate what the patterns would look like, and then compare this to the heat maps of the pattern matching results for each colony, you can see that most of the patterns become quite understandable. 
Am I reading too much into the reults? Is it unfair to make the conclusions that I have made? After looking at all 150ish heat maps, and comparing them to my theorhetical vocalization patterns in Figure 2, I think that I am not. But please act as a sanity check for me.",,

Washington,Washington State,"Fidorra, Jason C",Jason.Fidorra@dfw.wa.gov,"ARUs were deployed at two sites over the course of three years. All three years successfully fledged young at both sites. Interestingly, in both 2023 and 2024, TRBLs nested first at McCain wetlands and then at McCain Wetlands. The timing is consistent with the birds finishing their nesting at McCain Wetlands and then moving to Harder Springs for a second round of breeding.","Analysis of recordings of the Washington birds required using local templates for many of the vocalizations. I am not certain if this was due to differences in the vocalizations themselves, or the fact that the background noises were significantly different. It would be interesting to know if the same birds are utilizing both McCain Wetlands and Harder Springs.",,"Jason Fidorra, Wildlife Biologist, Washington Dept of Fish & Wildlife"

Sedgwick,Sedgwick Preserve,Heather,,"Your ARUs were deployed at a single location over the course of four years. Eggs hatched successfully during each of the four years, and for three of those years, we confirmed successful fledging of young. The breeding pattern of the colony varied from year to year, including Replacement and Continuous (Figure 3). Details for each deployment are described below.","This site offers challenges in its analysis. The colony is relatively small, so there aren't as many vocalizations to be recorded as with other sites. The birds co-nest with similar-sounding species such as Red-winged Blackbird, making the identification of TRBL calls a little more difficult. Additionally, this colony can exhibit continuous breeding, where ongoing loud calls from males and fledglings further obscures faint vocalizations such as female chatter and hatchling begging calls. As a result, future analysis should be especially cautious about the site. Depending on the level of accuracy required, occasional site visits could be done to supplement the analysis, and manual analysis of recordings could be done instead of relying on pattern matching.

The site is consistently used by TRBLs for breeding and is the last documented colony in Santa Barbara county. As their nesting pond is located on protected habitat, is surrounded by sufficient foraging locations, and is being carefully managed for their protection, I am hopeful that this colony will continue to thrive long into the future. A potential key to enhancing the odds of their long-term success would be to identify the wintering locations for this set of birds, so that also could be protected.",Sedgwick Reserve,Mark Holmgren
