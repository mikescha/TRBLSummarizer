Wind Wolves Preserve,,,,"I have been working with the Wind Wolves preserve for four years and with your help I was able to deploy nine ARUs. Eight colonies were detected, all of which successfully fledged young. At one site, only a few male songs were detected, and no colony formed.","To date, the colonies that form at your site are successful. First hatchlings are consistently detected the first week in May. In 2024, breeding started earlier, and there was even a second bout of breeding at Pleitito. This was the first site where I noted the male song that has the uprising clear note at the beginning. I have since located this version of male song at other locations, though not at the abundance as at your site.",,
Colusa NWR,,,,"The breeding attempts at these locations tends to be at the end of the breeding season. The size of the colony is highly variable with some years being in the 10s of thousands of birds, and other times just a handful. No colonies at the Delevan sites were ever documented.","Bob, I could use help here.",,
Monterey,,,,A few words summarizing the results about their sites.,Discussion of the results specific to this group.,,
Iron Point,,"Jennifer Brown, Emillie Graves, Dan Ariola",,The colonies that form here generally abandon their attempts. They only successfully formed a colony and fledged young in 2019. ,"In 2018 there a housing complex formed adjacent to the colony. Though the birds appear to continue to try at this location, only one of the five successfully fledged young. It would be interesting to see how long the birds contiue to ""waste their effort"" by continuing to try to nest at this location.",,
Markham Ravine,,"Tara, Charolette",,"The first two ARUs here were LG recorders which provided weak recordings and were unreliable with quality and consistency. The site is not reliably occupied, but when it is occupied, the colonies are generally successful.",,,
Placer County,,Deren Ross,,"Of the three colonies, one abandoned, one had a single bout of successful breeding, and the third had two waves of successful breeding. I have field notes for the 2021 season that complement the audio analysis.",,,
Solano County,,Wendy,,,,,
Bob's Sites,,Bob,,"The recorders that you placed were largely successful at capturing the vocalizations of the colonies. There were only a handful that had uncertain outcomes. For one the batteries failed. This was probably before I discovered the Duracell Optimum, and I know that in at least one of your units the batteries actuallly exploded in the case. There were a handful of times when the recorder was retrieved after the majority of the birds were done breeding, but there was a little ghost of a few birds that apparently were still nesting. These were minor issues, as the bulk of the breeding attempt was captured on the recordings.","As I have analyzed more colonies, I have found a relatively messy world. But if you take the four main ways a colony forms, and then map the predicted vocalization patterns of colonies in Figure 2 to generate what the patterns would look like, and then compare this to the heat maps of the pattern matching results for each colony, you can see that most of the patterns become quite understandable. 
Am I reading too much into the reults? Is it unfair to make the conclusions that I have made? After looking at all 150ish heat maps, and comparing them to my theorhetical vocalization patterns in Figure 2, I think that I am not. But please act as a sanity check for me.",,
Baja,,Richard Erickson,,"Except for one year all ARUs picked up the TRBL vocalizations really well and analysis was straight forward. For one delpoyment (2023 Baja Rancho Cinega) the audio was muffled. This could have been from a unit with a poor microphone, the recorder being placed upside down in the drybox, or it being placed distant to the colony. In general the colonies took on either single synchronous or replacement forms of breeding. In 2023 the data looks like it is continuous, but this could be due to the lack of Female Chatter, Hatchling Begging Calls, and Fledgling Begging Calls, and it is also possible that the colony had two replacement bouts of breeding in addition to the original bout, similar to the 2024 sites.","The populations that are monitored through these ARUs represent the most southerly TRBL colonies. Given that they are in another country, management of their habitat will provide unique challenges. Determining if there are unique male songs to this group, was well as further study of groups just accross the boarder, might help to determine if the Baja population is a unique breeding group that is worthy of special effort, or if there is the chance that some of the most southerly colonies in the US might act a source for the same group of birds.",,
San Jacinto Wildlife Area,,,,,,,
Dairies,,,,"We were able to sequre permission to place three recorders on provate dairy properties. All three colonies were highly asynchronous, and all three successfully produced fledglings.","Due to the sensitive nature of having protected species on private lands it is difficult to gain permission for placement of ARUs onto these private lands. Because of this, birds that nest in triticale, or other substrates that the dairies provide are vastly under represented in our data sets. This is particulalry a shame as a large percentage of the population utilizes this tpe of habitat.",,
Merced and San Luis NWR,,,,The birds use the sites here inconsistently. Because of this the ARUs are not placed until a colony has already settled. There were multiple times when the vocalizations were difficult to detect. Closer placement to the colony could yeild better results. The Female Chatter for some birds seems to be higher in pitch. I have noted this at other colonies as well.,,,
Washington,Washington State,"Fidorra, Jason C",Jason.Fidorra@dfw.wa.gov,"ARUs were deployed at two sites over the course of three years. All three years successfully fledged young at both sites. Interestingly, in both 2023 and 2024, TRBLs nested first at McCain wetlands and then at McCain Wetlands. The timing is consistent with the birds finishing their nesting at McCain Wetlands and then moving to Harder Springs for a second round of breeding.","Analysis of recordings of the Washington birds required using local templates for many of the vocalizations. I am not certain if this was due to differences in the vocalizations themselves, or the fact that the background noises were significantly different. It would be interesting to know if the same birds are utilizing both McCain Wetlands and Harder Springs.",,"Jason Fidorra, Wildlife Biologist, Washington Dept of Fish & Wildlife"
Oregon,,,,"The Oregon colonies tended to be small and often lacked male chorus. Out of the 6 deployments, 4 detected the presence of colonies and also detected successfully fledged young.","While these colonies represent a small fraction of the population, these colonies may become imortant strongholds for the long term survival of the species.",,
Los Vaqueros,,,,"The location that is most reliably inhabited by a TRBL colony resulted in successful breeding in every year that an ARU was placed. Even the year where the birds abandoned due to weather, there was a Repeat attempt which was quite successful.","The colony at Los Vaqueros is well documented by the Mount Diablo Audubon Society, how make regular visits to the colony to monitor it in person. Because of this there are additional notes about disturbances such as wild pigs, and observations of potential predators. This extra data could be used to dig deeper into additional vocalizations that TRBLs make. Particularly, it may be possible to determine different alarm calls.",,
CNLM,,,,"CNLM has placed recorders on several of their properties in multiple colonies. When colonies do form, they were successful. The only two sites were there was not successful breeding there was no audio evidence that a colony formed, and it appears in these two instances the birds moved on before the colony was established. For the Dagnino Pond, Amy did note that she saw some females carrying nesting material approximately 2 weeks before the recorder was placed. By the time the recorder was placed the birds had moved on. It could be that this colony should be considered Abandoned, but I need to check with Bob on this.","The largest challenge I see with the CNLM sites is the fact that the birds visit sporadically, and thus by the time I am notified that the birds are present, and I get the recorders into the mail, and they are able to place them we have missed the beginning of the breeding. Since the recorders are relatively inexpensive, if CNLM would like to monitor their TRBL colonies, I would suggest that each location have one or two on hand so they can more quickly respond to the presence of a settlement.",,

Rancho Jamul,,,,,,,
Sedgwick,Sedgwick Preserve,Heather,,"Your ARUs were deployed at a single location over the course of four years. Eggs hatched successfully during each of the four years, and for three of those years, we confirmed successful fledging of young. The breeding pattern of the colony varied from year to year, including Replacement and Continuous (Figure 3). Details for each deployment are described below.","This site offers challenges in its analysis. The colony is relatively small, so there aren't as many vocalizations to be recorded as with other sites. The birds co-nest with similar-sounding species such as Red-winged Blackbird, making the identification of TRBL calls a little more difficult. Additionally, this colony can exhibit continuous breeding, where ongoing loud calls from males and fledglings further obscures faint vocalizations such as female chatter and hatchling begging calls. As a result, future analysis should be especially cautious about the site. Depending on the level of accuracy required, occasional site visits could be done to supplement the analysis, and manual analysis of recordings could be done instead of relying on pattern matching.

The site is consistently used by TRBLs for breeding and is the last documented colony in Santa Barbara county. As their nesting pond is located on protected habitat, is surrounded by sufficient foraging locations, and is being carefully managed for their protection, I am hopeful that this colony will continue to thrive long into the future. A potential key to enhancing the odds of their long-term success would be to identify the wintering locations for this set of birds, so that also could be protected.",Sedgwick Reserve,Mark Holmgren
