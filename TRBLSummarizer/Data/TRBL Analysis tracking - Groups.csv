Wind Wolves Preserve,,,,,"I have been working with the Wind Wolves preserve for four years and with your help I was able to deploy nine ARUs. Eight colonies were detected, all of which successfully fledged young. At one site, only a few male songs were detected, and no colony formed.","To date, the colonies that form at your site are successful. First hatchlings are consistently detected the first week in May. In 2024, breeding started earlier, and there was even a second bout of breeding at Pleitito. This was the first site where I noted the male song that has the uprising clear note at the beginning. I have since located this version of male song at other locations, though not at the abundance as at your site.",
Colusa NWR,,,,,,"Colusa NWR provides extensive wetland habitat used by Tricolored Blackbirds late in the breeding season, likely by birds dispersing from earlier nesting locations. The acoustic record shows considerable year-to-year variability in colony size and location, with colonies forming at one or both ponds in some years and no colonies forming in others. The presence of Fledgling Begging Calls prior to the onset of local Brooding at some sites indicates that adults occasionally arrive with fledglings from a previous attempt, further supporting the interpretation that many Colusa colonies represent later-season nesting bouts.

As at other sites, ARUs sometimes captured only part of the colony cycle when devices were deployed after nest initiation or failed before fledging. Despite these constraints, the recordings were sufficient to document breeding chronology and determine outcomes for most attempts, including identification of a heat-related Partial Abandonment in 2024.

Monterey,,,,,A few words summarizing the results about their sites.,Discussion of the results specific to this group.,
Iron Point,,"Jennifer Brown, Emillie Graves, Dan Ariola",,,,"The Iron Point deployments illustrate a site where birds regularly initiate breeding but seldom complete it successfully. Of the five monitored seasons, only one resulted in a successful breeding attempt. The surrounding suburban environment, including ongoing construction adjacent to the breeding substrate, likely influences site stability and may contribute to repeated failures. These observations highlight the importance of understanding how disturbance and habitat modification affect colony persistence and reproductive outcomes.",
Markham Ravine,,"Tara, Charolette",,,,"Markham Ravine supported colonies in most monitored years, with breeding outcomes generally successful except for two partially abandoned attempts. In two deployments, no Tricolored Blackbirds were detected, reflecting annual variability in site occupancy typical of colonies in dynamic landscapes. Signal quality varied across deployments because two early ARUs used nonstandard devices, although manual review compensated for their limitations. When occupied, colonies produced clear acoustic signatures of breeding-stage transitions, enabling reliable reconstruction of chronology and outcomes.",
Placer County,,Deren Ross,,,"Of the three colonies, one abandoned, one had a single bout of successful breeding, and the third had two waves of successful breeding. I have field notes for the 2021 season that complement the audio analysis.",,

Bob's Sites,,Bob,,,"The recorders that you placed were largely successful at capturing the vocalizations of the colonies. There were only a handful that had uncertain outcomes. For one the batteries failed. This was probably before I discovered the Duracell Optimum, and I know that in at least one of your units the batteries actuallly exploded in the case. There were a handful of times when the recorder was retrieved after the majority of the birds were done breeding, but there was a little ghost of a few birds that apparently were still nesting. These were minor issues, as the bulk of the breeding attempt was captured on the recordings.","As I have analyzed more colonies, I have found a relatively messy world. But if you take the four main ways a colony forms, and then map the predicted vocalization patterns of colonies in Figure 2 to generate what the patterns would look like, and then compare this to the heat maps of the pattern matching results for each colony, you can see that most of the patterns become quite understandable. 
Am I reading too much into the reults? Is it unfair to make the conclusions that I have made? After looking at all 150ish heat maps, and comparing them to my theorhetical vocalization patterns in Figure 2, I think that I am not. But please act as a sanity check for me.",
Baja,,Richard Erickson,,,,"The Baja sites represent the southernmost Tricolored Blackbird colonies monitored in this study and occupy a distinct portion of the species’ range. Their location outside the United States introduces unique management considerations, and additional work on both sides of the border may clarify whether these colonies represent a genetically or behaviorally differentiated breeding group. In particular, further bioacoustic analysis of Male Song variation and comparison with the nearest U.S. colonies could help determine whether Baja populations warrant targeted conservation attention or whether northern colonies may serve as a demographic or genetic source for this region. Across deployments, most Baja colonies showed continuous Male Chorus with discrete breeding bouts. Nearly all attempts resulted in successful fledging, and no weather-related failures or substrate disturbances were detected acoustically. One site (2023 Rancho Cienega) had reduced signal quality that limited resolution of early-stage vocalizations, but Fledgling Begging Calls were sufficient to reconstruct colony structure and assign outcomes.",
San Jacinto Wildlife Area,,,,,,,
Dairies,,,,,,"The dairy-associated colonies exhibited strongly asynchronous breeding structure, with extended periods of overlap among Female Chatter, Nestling Begging Calls, and Fledgling Begging Calls. This pattern reflects continual nest initiation and a lack of colony-wide synchrony, consistent with what has been observed at other dairy and feedlot sites where food resources are abundant and habitat structure may promote dispersed nesting. All three colonies successfully fledged young.",
Merced and San Luis NWR,,,,,The birds use the sites here inconsistently. Because of this the ARUs are not placed until a colony has already settled. There were multiple times when the vocalizations were difficult to detect. Closer placement to the colony could yeild better results. The Female Chatter for some birds seems to be higher in pitch. I have noted this at other colonies as well.,,
Washington,Washington State,"Fidorra, Jason C",Jason.Fidorra@dfw.wa.gov,,"ARUs were deployed at two sites over the course of three years. All three years successfully fledged young at both sites. Interestingly, in both 2023 and 2024, TRBLs nested first at McCain wetlands and then at McCain Wetlands. The timing is consistent with the birds finishing their nesting at McCain Wetlands and then moving to Harder Springs for a second round of breeding.","Analysis of recordings of the Washington birds required using local templates for many of the vocalizations. I am not certain if this was due to differences in the vocalizations themselves, or the fact that the background noises were significantly different. It would be interesting to know if the same birds are utilizing both McCain Wetlands and Harder Springs.",
Oregon,,,,,"The Oregon colonies tended to be small and often lacked male chorus. Out of the 6 deployments, 4 detected the presence of colonies and also detected successfully fledged young.","While these colonies represent a small fraction of the population, these colonies may become imortant strongholds for the long term survival of the species.",
Los Vaqueros,,,,"The fully abandoned colony at the 2023 Los Vaqueros Walnut Trail site coincided with a sharp temperature increase during the onset of Brooding. At the 2024 Los Vaqueros site, feral pigs disrupted the nesting substrate before the first breeding attempt. Although the first attempt was classified as Partial Abandonment, the timing of the disturbance suggests it was not the cause. ",,"The colony at Los Vaqueros is well documented by the Mount Diablo Bird Alliance, who make regular visits to monitor the site in person. Because of this, additional notes are available about disturbances such as feral pigs and observations of potential predators including coyote and snakes. These additional data will support deeper analysis of TRBL vocal behavior, including the potential to distinguish multiple types of alarm calls.",Mount Diablo Bird Alliance
CNLM,,,,,,"Breeding activity at CNLM sites varied from year to year, with colonies forming in some locations while others were only briefly visited by birds before they moved on. Because colonies were generally discovered after settlement had begun, ARUs were often placed after early breeding stages had passed, limiting detection of Male Chorus and early Female Chatter. Despite these constraints, the acoustic record was sufficient to document colony establishment and reconstruct breeding chronologies for nearly all active sites. All established colonies succeeded except for one partially abandoned attempt.",

Sedgwick,Sedgwick Preserve,Heather,,,,"The colony at Sedgwick Preserve presents unique analytical challenges compared to other monitored sites. The colony is relatively small, and as a result the number of detectable vocalizations was lower than at larger sites. The birds also co-occur with Red-winged Blackbirds, whose vocalizations sometimes overlap with or resemble those of Tricolored Blackbirds, making certain call types—particularly Female Chatter—more difficult to validate with confidence. In addition, Sedgwick periodically exhibits continuous or near-continuous breeding activity; when loud calls from males and fledglings are present for extended periods, quieter vocalizations such as Female Chatter and Hatchling Begging Calls can be partially or fully masked.

Despite these limitations, all four deployments documented active breeding, and three years confirmed successful fledging. Acoustic patterns indicating colony formation type were consistent: the colony exhibited Multiple nesting in one year and Asynchronous nesting in others. In-person visits conducted in 2023 aligned closely with the acoustic interpretation, including observations of fledglings dispersing on the date indicated by a sharp drop in Fledgling Begging Calls. No disturbances or environmental events were detected acoustically that could explain variation in effort or recruitment across the four years. Given its location on protected habitat with access to surrounding foraging grounds, Sedgwick Preserve appears to support a small but stable colony that continues to return annually. Regular acoustic monitoring, supplemented occasionally by visual confirmation, will improve future assessments of Female Chatter and Brooding onset and will help clarify whether the colony’s intermittent continuous breeding reflects local conditions or inherent colony structure.",Sedgwick Reserve
