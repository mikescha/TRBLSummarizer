New Edge Analysis
-----------------
#1
Currently we count the number of recordings that have p1n and p2n. 

New: If there is a p2n tag AND anywhere in that site there is a YNC-p2
		for all P2N count the number of YNC-p2 for that day
else
	count the number of p2n

Then graph just like today. So basically it's just replacing the p2n data set with the ync-p2 set if any ync-p2 tags exist


#2
New tag: tag<p1f>
New song: val<Agelaius tricolor/Simple Call 2>

Sum up P1F recordings/day

If any days have both P1N and P1F, then flag it as an error

For P1N, sum the Alt song like today
For P1F, sum the Simple song
Sum the two columns `
